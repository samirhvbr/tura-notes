# ⛔ THE SESSION BINDING IS REQUIRED, AND THIS SCRIPT REFUSES WITHOUT IT.
#
# Owner's verdict, 2026-09-11 (box `A66`, after `A65` settled the same question
# inside EOP): the shortcut refuses to arm without an explicit session binding.
# Exit non-zero and say why, instead of adopting the first stop.
#
# 🔴 What this replaces, measured twice and never guessed. The script used to
# pass `--adotar-primeira-parada`, which binds the round to the FIRST session
# that ends a turn in this tree — any chat left open will do.
#
#   · 2026-09-01, EOP: the round adopted a session the owner had open to triage
#     Dependabot PRs. 18 journal entries filed under unrelated items, 4 spurious
#     queue items, two sessions driving one tree, four `version.md` collisions
#     and two red `master` (P-09).
#   · 2026-09-10, EOP: it fired again THREE times inside a single round, each
#     time erasing a binding that had been set correctly — and each time
#     silently, because adopting looks exactly like working.
#
# ⚠️ A shell genuinely does not know its own session_id. That is why the id is
# handed in rather than guessed: the agent knows its own, the operator can read
# it, and a wrong guess is the defect above.
#
# ⚠️ Not re-arming is an inconvenience; re-arming on the wrong process is the bug.

DURACAO=""

# 🔴 EVERY ARGUMENT IS CLASSIFIED, AND WHAT IS NOT RECOGNISED IS NAMED —
# measured on 2026-09-11, the first real use of the refusal above.
#
# The operator typed `./loop.sh EOP-b3building 16h`. The old `case` matched the
# glob `*[0-9a-fA-F]-*[0-9a-fA-F]*`, which `EOP-b3building` fails (the character
# before the `-` is `P`), so the argument was SILENTLY DISCARDED, slid into the
# duration slot, and the refusal said *"you passed no binding"* when the fact
# was *"what you passed is not an id"*. A guard that refuses for the wrong
# reason teaches the wrong lesson.
#
# ⛔ And there was a worse case, reachable at the time: with `LOOP_SESSAO` set in
# the environment, `./loop.sh EOP-b3building` sent `--duracao EOP-b3building`
# straight to `loop-ctl`.
#
# ⚠️ The id shape is strict on purpose (8-4-4-4-12). The old glob was so loose
# that plenty of non-ids passed as bindings — and a binding that can never match
# produces a round that never continues, whose symptom is SILENCE. Refusing
# loudly beats arming quietly on something that cannot work.

# ── the session binding ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# With an id: `--sessao <id>`. Without one: `--escolher-sessao`, which lists the
# sessions of this repository and asks which drives the round — a digit instead
# of a UUID, and it prints the CONFIG PROFILE of each (`.claude-blue3`,
# `.claude-pessoal`, …), which is how personal work is told from company work on
# one machine.
#
# ⛔ It still never guesses. With no terminal to ask (cron, CI, a pipe) it
# refuses, because the decision stays human — what changed is the cost of saying
# it, not who says it. The blind adoption that `--adotar-primeira-parada` did is
# gone since 0.3.15: on 2026-09-01 it bound the round to the chat the owner had
# open to triage PRs (18 journal entries filed under unrelated items, 4 spurious
# queue items, four `version.md` collisions, two red `master`), and on 2026-09-10
# it fired three times in one round, erasing a binding that was correct.
