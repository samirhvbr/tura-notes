/**
 * The frontend half of reconciliation (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §8).
 *
 * The core does the deciding — `stat`, then hash, then a verdict. This store
 * does two things the core cannot: it says **which notes are dirty**, because
 * the buffers live here, and it turns the resulting events into what the
 * interface shows.
 *
 * Two clocks, for the two cases §8 names:
 *
 * - a **tick** every 300 ms, which is a channel read when nothing has happened.
 *   With the watcher's own 200 ms debounce that keeps the 0.1b criterion —
 *   *"editar no VS Code com o app aberto atualiza a aba em <1s"* — with room to
 *   spare;
 * - a **full scan** on window focus, on a manual refresh, and every 5 s when
 *   there is no watcher at all (a network mount, a kernel out of inotify
 *   watches).
