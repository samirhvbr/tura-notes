## D-01 — The registry debounce `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.1 describes does not exist, and nothing here adds it

**Found, not decided.** §4.1 says the registry is *"written atomically (tmp +
rename), debounced to at most one write per 2 s, and on shutdown"*. The debounce
is not implemented: `open_note` calls `state::store` on every observe, as do
save, reconcile and the preview's asset path. Every mutation is written
immediately.

**Why it came up.** The workspace selector switches with `close` then `open`
(the workspace-selector design), and the question was whether the third
path — `open_workspace` called while another workspace is open, which replaces
`self.open` outright — could drop an unwritten registry change. With the
debounce as documented, it could: identity is **operational** state
([ADR-015](decisions.md#adr-015--the-registry-is-operational-state-and-moves-to-its-own-database-at-02)), and a lost `NoteId` is a tab that cannot find its
note and, at 0.6, a file re-uploaded as new. Without it, there is nothing
unwritten to drop.

**What was done, and what was undone.** A store-before-adopt was written into
`open_workspace` and then removed, because `tests/switch.rs` passed identically
with and without it — a test that cannot fail is not evidence, and a fix with no
demonstrated defect is a claim. The tests stay: they pin the property
(*identity survives a switch*) rather than a mechanism, and nothing had ever
exercised the switch path at all, because until this milestone the only route to
it was a Welcome screen that disappears after the first open.

**Resolved at 0.14.0.** ADR-039 and architecture §4.1 now document immediate
SQLite persistence; no debounce is claimed. The original finding follows.

**What this left at 0.13.0.** Two documents that disagreed. The day the debounce is
implemented — and §4.1 is right that it should be, since `~/x` writes the whole
registry on every note opened — `open_workspace` becomes a loss path and
`tests/switch.rs` starts failing, which is the outcome to want.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Implement the debounce now and add the
store-before-adopt with it. That is a core change in a milestone whose §5 says
the core does not change for the interface, and it is a performance change made
without a measurement.

## D-02 — A DOM test environment enters the repository, for focus

**Decided.** `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`
and `@testing-library/jest-dom` join the **dev** dependencies. `vitest`'s
environment stays `node` by default and a file opts in with
`// @vitest-environment jsdom` on its first line.

**Gap closed.** The original acceptance asked, in its own words, for
*"teste de componente com foco rastreado"* on the menus. Focus is not a
property a reducer has. A pure state machine can prove which row is *selected*;
only a document can prove that closing the menu put focus back on the button
that opened it — and that is the failure being guarded against, because a menu
that keeps focus leaves a keyboard user on `<body>` with no way back into the
interface.

**Why it is defensible under scope §19**, which tells an agent to stop before a
central dependency: these are four **development** dependencies that ship in
nothing. `vite build` does not see them, the `.deb` does not contain them, and
removing them costs one test file. The stack table in §4 is about what the
product is built from; this is about what the tests are run in.

The default stays `node` because the store tests are pure logic and a DOM around
them would be slower and would let a test accidentally depend on one.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Extract the menu's key handling into a reducer
and test that, with the focus calls untested. It adds no dependency and it does
not test the thing that breaks.

## D-03 — The editor column is a fixed maximum, not a setting

**Decided.** ~700 px, in CSS, not in `settings.json`.

**Gap closed.** The original plan's first open question.

**Why.** The rule is *the simplest option compatible with the scope*, and the
scope's settings list is closed: §17 puts *"configurações mínimas (font, line
numbers, wrap, tab size)"* in 0.1c and names the four. A fifth arrives with a
schema field, a migration, a control, two catalogue keys and a row in the
settings panel — for a value whose good range is narrow and whose bad values are
all worse. A measure that is too wide is the specific thing this column exists
to prevent.

It is a CSS custom property (`--column`), so changing it is one line and no
migration, which is the reversibility that makes deciding now cheap.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Add it to `editor` in `settings.json` with the
other four. It is a schema bump and it is the kind of setting people ask for.

## D-04 — Split is horizontal only in this milestone

**Decided.** One vertical divider, two panes side by side. No vertical split, no
grid, no more than two panes.

**Gap closed.** The original plan's second open question.

**Why.** Split already exists as a *view mode* — source, preview, split
(scope §9, `ADR-030`) — and 0.1d's job is to give it a real divider and a second
header, not to turn it into a window manager. Two panes side by side is what the
milestone's own drawing shows. Anything beyond that needs a layout tree, which
needs to be persisted in `session.json`, which is a schema change in a milestone
that is meant not to touch the core.

**Alternative if you disagree.** A layout tree from the start, so the second
split never has to migrate the first. It is the right shape for the eventual
feature and it is several times this milestone's frontend work.

## D-05 — Welcome stays a screen, and does not become an empty shell

**Decided.** With no workspace open the window shows the Welcome screen, not the
rail-and-empty-sidebar shell.

**Gap closed.** The original plan's third open question.

**Why.** Every control in the shell operates on a workspace: the explorer lists
one, the tab bar holds notes from one, the note header acts on one, the status
bar reports one. An empty shell is a window of controls that all do nothing,
which reads as an application that has failed to load rather than one waiting
for a folder. Welcome asks the only question there is to ask.

It also keeps §3's second principle — *nada mente na tela* — without a special
case: there is no disabled toolbar to explain and no empty tab bar to justify.

**Alternative if you disagree.** The shell with an empty sidebar, which is what
Obsidian does and which makes opening a folder feel like a smaller step. It
costs an empty state for every panel in the shell rather than one screen.

## D-06 — Back and forward are one history for the window, not one per tab

**Decided.** `stores/history.ts` keeps a single list of visited paths with a
cursor. The note header's two arrows move it.

**Gap closed.** The original interface plan says *"voltar/avançar
(histórico da aba)"*, and a per-tab history does not have anything to hold.

**Why.** A tab in this application is a **note**, not a viewport (ADR-030).
Opening a note from the tree, from quick open or from a search hit either
activates its existing tab or makes one; there is no navigating *within* a tab,
so a per-tab history would be a list of one entry that never grows. What a
person means by "back" is *the note I was looking at before this one*, and that
is a fact about the window.

The list holds **paths rather than `NoteId`s**, so a note deleted while it is in
the history simply fails to open and is stepped over, instead of holding an
identity the registry has forgotten. It is bounded at 100 and everything ahead
of the cursor is dropped on a new visit, which is what makes it a history rather
than a ring.

**Alternative if you disagree.** A history per tab, which becomes meaningful at
0.3 when a wiki link can navigate inside a tab without opening a new one. That
is the milestone to build it in, against a case that exists.

## D-07 — Contrast is checked as three different things, and the script says which

**Decided.** `tools/contrast.sh` applies WCAG 4.5:1 to text, WCAG 3:1 to the
focus ring and to disabled controls, and an **8/255 sRGB step** to the three
dark surfaces and the divider. It also fails the build on any hex written
outside `:root`.

**Gap closed.** The original acceptance asks for *"contraste AA de cada
par texto/superfície, verificado por script"*. Writing it revealed that "AA" is
not one number and does not answer every question the palette raises.

**Why not one rule for everything.** The first version held `--line` to 3:1 and
the surface levels to a 1.15:1 ratio, and both were wrong:

- **1.4.11 does not cover a divider.** It covers visual information required to
  *identify a component or its state*. A rule between two panels that are
  already different surfaces identifies nothing — remove it and the sidebar is
  still a sidebar. At 3:1 it would be a near-white hairline, brighter than the
  secondary text beside it.
- **A contrast ratio is the wrong instrument near black.** The formula adds 0.05
  to both luminances to model ambient flare, and at these depths that constant
  dominates: three surfaces anyone can tell apart score 1.05–1.13, and no
  palette that still reads as one tone of dark reaches 1.15 on the second step.
  What a bad panel loses is **code values near black**, so the check is a step in
  sRGB.

**What it caught, which is the argument for having it.** The palette committed
minutes earlier had levels 1.05:1 apart — the exact failure §5 names.
`--disabled` was at 2.15:1, a smudge rather than the legible-but-inert control
§3 asks for. `--fg-dim` on a selected row was 4.36:1. And thirty-odd colours
were written inline, where no checker could reach them.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Check AA on text only and leave the levels to
judgement. It is the smaller script, and the level failure is the one nobody
notices until they open the application on a different screen.
