The `notes-sync` crate defines causal revision histories and produces plans.
`notes-core` supplies bounded inventories of real folders, and the standalone
`notes-sync-plan` command previews initial pairing. Planning never copies,
overwrites or deletes source notes. The server inbox and device client below transfer immutable bytes with durable
queues. Explicit closed-workspace application, desktop scheduling and app
controls are described below; remaining work is limited to the queue linked
above.

## Run the preview

Build with `cargo build --locked -p notes-core --bin notes-sync-plan`, or use the
standalone Linux archive from the release. The CLI accepts two distinct,
non-nested folders already mounted on the machine:

```sh
notes-sync-plan reconcile /notes/laptop /notes/server-copy /private/sync-preview
```

The last path is an absolute operational directory outside both folders. It
holds the core's identities so repeated previews retain note IDs. It contains no
copy of source content. A rejected state location creates nothing inside the
source folders. The command uses the core's path jail and ignore rules; it does
not follow workspace symlinks or inspect hidden internals. Output is JSON
containing relative paths, identities and content hashes, never note text.

The modes are deliberately distinct:

| Mode | Precondition | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| `upload` | The remote inventory is empty | Upload local notes |
| `download` | The local inventory is empty | Download remote notes |
| `reconcile` | Either or both may contain notes | Link equal same-path content, identify conflicts and list unique notes |

The commands above describe preview actions, not network requests. “Remote”
here names the second mounted folder. No URL, bearer token or listening port is
used by this first block. A populated target is never treated as a download or
upload destination to be replaced wholesale. Matching content at unrelated
paths does not silently merge note identities. Initial identity links are
explicit output for the eventual pairing confirmation, not applied changes.

Inventories are limited to 10,000 Markdown files and 8 MiB per file. Hashes
cover original bytes, including BOM and line endings; mixed/non-UTF-8 data is
not decoded and re-serialized. Normal lazy explorer listing is unchanged. This
explicit inventory can assign identities to previously unopened notes in
operational state and reconcile unambiguous external renames; it does not add
note visits or save notes. The preview is not a transaction across two live
folders: any later application must revalidate the observed revisions and
filesystem capabilities.

## Causal model

Each immutable revision has a UUID, note identity, device UUID, zero to two
parents, a relative path and either a content hash or a tombstone. A note has
one genesis revision containing real content. Empty bytes have their actual
hash; they are not a deletion. A rename changes the path while keeping note
identity and ancestry. `modified_at` is absent from this model.

A journal has an explicitly paired workspace UUID and separate current heads.
Imported history does not choose a head. Validation rejects cycles, missing or
foreign-note parents, duplicate conflicting revision UUIDs, unrelated roots
claiming the same note identity and incompatible schemas. A head changes only
through compare-and-set of the observed head. Exact path collisions refuse the
change. Filesystem case/normalization constraints must additionally be checked
by application using the target adapter.

The incremental planner compares ancestry:

- Equal heads need no work.
- A descendant can be pushed or pulled against the expected previous head.
- Divergent edits, rename/edit and delete/edit combinations remain conflicts.
- Equal values on divergent branches require a merge revision retaining both
  parents; equal bytes do not erase causality.
- Different note identities competing for the same path produce a collision,
  not an overwriting push/pull.
- A missing head is unknown, not a deletion. Only a tombstone requests deletion.

Explicit resolution creates a new revision with both observed parents and the
chosen path/content. Applying it still compares each peer's expected head; a
stale resolution cannot replace newer edits. Device acknowledgments name exact
revisions and cannot move backward along ancestry. Acknowledgments do not prune
history or tombstones in this block.

## Persistent metadata

`notes_sync::store::Store` holds schema-1 `journal.json` under an operator-chosen
private directory. Readers/writers use an OS lock, and writes compare the digest
returned by the read, validate the new graph, sync a private temporary file and
atomically replace the journal. A stale transaction, failed callback, invalid
graph or future/corrupt schema leaves the prior bytes intact. On Unix the
operational directory is mode 0700 and new files are mode 0600.

The journal is bounded to 100,000 revisions, 1,024 acknowledging devices and
64 MiB of serialized state. Reaching a bound is an explicit refusal, not silent
history pruning. This is metadata storage only; immutable content storage and
its retention policy are not implemented yet. There is no schema migration in
the first version. A future migration must preserve a pre-migration copy and
provide recovery before replacing state; unknown schemas are never reset.

## Validation and remaining work

Tests cover one-sided changes, divergent equal content, stale compare-and-set,
explicit two-parent resolution, delete/edit and rename/edit conflicts, path
collisions, invalid DAGs, monotonic receipts and state persistence across reopen.
Core/process tests inspect real BOM/CRLF/binary notes and verify byte preservation,
stable identity, external rename correlation and rejected populated pairing
modes. These tests exercise actual CLI execution, not only JSON fixtures.

Remaining work and owner acceptance are in
[the 0.6 queue](../.continue/0.6-sync.md). Milestone 0.7 remote MCP follows the
completed sync stage; the shipped local MCP and 0.5 REST server are unchanged.

## Server revision inbox (0.19.1)

The server now accepts and returns immutable revisions over its existing
HTTPS/authentication boundary. This is an inbox for replication, **not live
workspace synchronization**: neither publication nor download changes a file
under `workspaces/`. The client below supplies the outbox and explicit guarded application. Conflict workflow,
attachments and background/UI integration remain open.

The authenticated OpenAPI contract describes three operations:

- `GET /v1/workspaces/{workspace}/sync/revisions?cursor=0&limit=100` returns
  the inbox workspace UUID, a page of revision metadata, current heads for the
  notes on that page, the next append-log position and `has_more`.
- `GET /v1/workspaces/{workspace}/sync/revisions/{revision}` returns the
  immutable publication with canonical base64 of the original bytes.
- `POST /v1/workspaces/{workspace}/sync/revisions` atomically accepts a
  publication containing `workspace`, `expected`, `revision` and
  `content_base64`. The response says `stored: true, applied: false`.

`expected` is the observed inbox head UUID, or null for a new note. All parents
must already be stored or included in the bounded resolution envelope described
below (0.20.7). A stale head, reused UUID with different facts, foreign
workspace UUID or exact path collision returns 409. The device must retain its
unaccepted revision locally until an explicit resolution retains that history. Retrying the identical accepted publication succeeds even after the
head advances, without moving the head backward. No timestamp chooses a winner.

Read permission is mandatory. Genesis and resurrection also require Create;
live successors require Update, path changes require Move and tombstones require
Delete. Review-mode writes check both old and new paths under `scope/proposals`.
Every historical path for a note must be visible to the credential: a move out
of a subfolder hides the whole history from that subfolder's token. Hidden paths
are refused. Workspace names come from the credential, never from a supplied
filesystem path. UUIDs do not grant access. Device UUIDs are causal claims;
the authenticated credential remains the audit author.

Cursors count scanned append-log entries, including entries filtered by scope,
so they can reveal aggregate activity within the authorized workspace. Empty
pages can advance and must not terminate traversal while `has_more` is true.
Heads are current, not a snapshot across pages. Save `next_cursor` only after
processing the page and fetching required bytes. A restored older backup may
require explicit retained-history recovery (see the 0.20.15 section below);
do not reset a durable client cursor by hand. A storage receipt is not a device application acknowledgment. The inbox
UUID is created on first authorized inventory access and retained across restart
and backup/restore.

### Storage, limits and recovery

`sync/<workspace>/vault.json` is private server data containing both the causal
journal and append-ordered publications. This bounded first implementation
stores copies of revision content as base64 in the same atomic document rather
than publishing a head before a separate blob exists. Live Markdown remains the
source of truth. Loading verifies schema, parent order, head transitions and
content hashes. Publication holds a per-workspace OS lock, exclusively and
without waiting (a second writer gets `503 busy`), writes and syncs a private
temporary file, atomically replaces the document, and syncs the directory on
Unix. Reading pages and publications takes the same lock **shared and waits for
a writer** (since 1.8.13), so two devices reading at once both get an answer;
only the first read of a workspace with no vault yet goes through the exclusive
path, because it writes the vault that fixes the workspace's sync identity. A lost response is recovered by retrying the same publication. An
abandoned temporary file is never loaded as state; future/corrupt committed
state is refused without replacement. Operators can remove abandoned temporary
files while the server is stopped, after backing up the data.

Limits are 8 MiB per revision content, 20,000 revisions, 64 MiB cumulative
decoded content and 128 MiB serialized state per workspace (since 1.8.42; half
that before). Identical bytes in different revisions count separately.
Capacity refusal is HTTP 507 and leaves all accepted content intact. History and
tombstones are retained for the life of the inbox; there is no automatic garbage
collection or credential-driven purge ([ADR-087](decisions.md#adr-087--retention-never-purges-on-its-own-the-limits-go-up-and-the-client-warns-before-the-507)).

**Why these numbers.** The vault is one document, and every page and every
fetch loads, parses and revalidates all of it, so a request costs in proportion
to the vault. Measured at the old ceiling (30 MiB of content, a 42 MB vault):
about 99 ms per page or fetch in a release build
(`server/notes-server/tests/http.rs::vault_cost_at_the_capacity_ceiling`). At
the new ceiling a pass of twenty fetches costs about four seconds of server
time, and the eight request slots can hold about two gigabytes of parsed vault
at once, which is what a small VPS can carry. A larger ceiling needs a vault
that is not one document, not a larger number.

**The client warns before the ceiling.** `GET
/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/sync/capacity` (Read permission) answers
`content_bytes`, `max_content_bytes`, `revisions` and `max_revisions`. The
desktop client asks once per pass, never fails a pass over it, and from 80% of
either limit the device panel says the inbox is filling and that the operator
should prune confirmed history (`notes-server sync-prune`). A server older than
1.8.42 answers 404, and the panel then says nothing. This conservative retention is for a bounded first transport block,
not unlimited production history. Offline full-data backup includes the vault
and excludes its process lock. Restore preserves UUIDs, cursors and original
bytes. Retention migration and device-confirmed pruning remain future work.

Tests exercise HTTP publication/fetch, exact-byte preservation, retries after
head advancement, concurrent writers, stale writes, path collisions, quota
refusal, scope and review permissions, revocation, future/corrupt state refusal,
restart and offline backup/restore. No test claims remote source application or
mobile synchronization.

## Device transfer client (0.20.0)

`notes-sync-client` is an explicit command-line client with a persistent offline
outbox and received-content cache. **Transfer does not apply revisions to source
files.** Explicit application is a separate command added in 0.20.1. The initial block supported
whole-workspace, non-review credentials. Version 0.20.12 adds pinned subfolder
credentials and confirmed reconciliation with a populated remote, described below.
Review-mode credentials remain outside this device workflow.

Build with `cargo build --locked -p notes-sync-client`, or use the standalone
Linux release archive. Pair an existing source folder with an empty server inbox:

```sh
notes-sync-client init-upload /private/sync-state /home/me/notes https://notes.example home /private/integration.secret
notes-sync-client stage /private/sync-state
notes-sync-client transfer /private/sync-state /private/integration.secret
notes-sync-client status /private/sync-state
```

The explicit `init-upload` command confirms the chosen source, endpoint and
workspace. It refuses a populated server inbox or an existing client state.
There is no reset-by-reinitialization. The state directory must be absolute and
outside the source folder. Pairing fixes the remote inbox UUID, source root and
endpoint in schema-1 `client.json`. The token is read only when connecting, from
an absolute regular file (private permissions on Unix); it is never persisted
in client state, placed in command arguments or printed.

`stage` works offline. Core inventories retain note identities, capture original
bytes and check them against observed hashes. Changed/new notes append immutable
publications; unambiguous external renames retain identity. Pending predecessors
remain ordered even when several edits are staged before connecting. Source
bytes that change during capture cause refusal, preserving the prior queue.
Only saved bytes are captured, never an unsaved editor buffer. Missing tracked
notes are reported and **do not infer deletion**. Automatic tombstone capture,
rename cycles and explicit deletion/application flows remain queued.

`transfer` executes one bounded batch: at most 20 publications and one page of
20 incoming revisions. Run it again to continue. Each valid storage receipt is
checkpointed separately; a lost response leaves the exact publication UUID and
bytes queued for an idempotent retry. A stale head returns a conflict and keeps
that publication and its successors. No retry loop elects a winner. Offline,
revoked credential, busy/rate-limited and capacity errors stop the batch with
accepted progress already durable. Status can be inspected without connecting.

To receive into a second device's private cache:

```sh
notes-sync-client init-receive /private/receiver-state /home/me/notes https://notes.example home /private/integration.secret
notes-sync-client transfer /private/receiver-state /private/integration.secret
notes-sync-client received /private/receiver-state
notes-sync-client export /private/receiver-state REVISION_UUID
```

`init-receive` does not promise a download into the selected folder; it binds a
future source location while received revisions remain in private state. The
receiver validates the workspace UUID, append cursor, immutable metadata,
parentage and original-byte hashes. It saves the whole page and its content
before advancing the cursor. An interrupted or invalid fetch leaves that page
unconsumed. `received` lists metadata; `export` creates a new
`received-<revision>.md` file in the state directory, never overwriting an
existing file. This makes received bytes inspectable without claiming source
application. Before explicit application, status includes `applied: false`.

### Client transport and storage limits

The operator supplies one origin, with no credentials, path, query or fragment.
The client disables redirects, automatic retries and environment/system proxies.
It resolves and validates addresses, then pins those addresses for the process
while preserving TLS hostname verification. HTTPS is required. `--allow-private`
at initialization explicitly permits a private/loopback server and also permits
plain HTTP at a literal loopback IP for local operation. Link-local, unspecified,
multicast and cloud metadata addresses remain refused. The selected exception
is persisted with the endpoint. `NOTES_SYNC_CA_FILE` can add an explicitly
selected PEM trust anchor without disabling certificate verification.

The client uses reqwest 0.13.5 with its blocking, JSON and provider-free rustls
features, selecting ring explicitly. No HTTP dependency enters the domain or
core crates. See the [reqwest transport documentation](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.13.5/reqwest/)
for the underlying redirect, proxy and TLS defaults overridden here. Connect
and request timeouts are 10 and 30 seconds; DNS resolution also depends on the
operating system resolver. Responses are bounded to 16 MiB. The credential must
identify the pinned workspace and exact selected scope on every connection.

Client state has a 64 MiB serialized limit, 32 MiB cumulative decoded pending
and received content, and 10,000 pending/received publications. Source capture
is limited to 32 MiB total and 8 MiB per file. Private temporary files, OS locks,
file sync and atomic replacement protect checkpoints. Future/corrupt state is
refused unchanged. A state directory backup while the client is stopped includes
queued bytes and core identities; do not discard it to resolve a conflict.
There is no automatic or general history pruning or state migration. The
explicit resolved-branch payload compaction added in 0.20.19 is documented
below. Received history is not a backup policy. Transfer sends no device
application acknowledgment; the explicit
`acknowledge` command below does.

Validation includes fault-injected lost receipts, restart, repeated offline
edits, rejected incoming bytes, stale/server-rebound conflicts, unsafe state
paths, future schema and over-limit capture. The server smoke runs two actual
client processes over TCP, disconnects/restarts the native server, and repeats
the exchange through the CI HTTPS proxy. The HTTPS test first refuses its
untrusted certificate, then uses the test CA explicitly. Original BOM/CRLF and
non-UTF-8 bytes are compared after receipt and export; source folders remain
unchanged.


## Guarded source application (0.20.1)

After receiving revisions, close this workspace in notes and every local MCP or
server process using it. Use the updated 0.20.1 core in those processes. Then run:

```sh
notes-sync-client apply /private/receiver-state /home/me/.local/share/notes
notes-sync-client status /private/receiver-state
```

The second argument is the **actual application data directory**, not the
client's private `core/` directory. Use the configured `NOTES_DATA_DIR` when set;
otherwise core uses the platform data directory plus `notes` (on macOS,
`~/Library/Application Support/notes`; on Windows, `%APPDATA%/notes`). It must be
outside the source workspace. The first application pins its canonical location;
a later invocation with a different directory is refused. Keep the client state
and application data when backing up or recovering a device.

Only receive-mode clients can apply, at most 20 revisions per invocation, in
received order. New Markdown files and same-path updates are supported. The
core holds an exclusive activity lease and its existing write lock, refuses any
pending draft entry, validates names/path jail/collisions, and checks the full
observed BaseRev and local identity before updating. Existing files are not
adopted merely because their bytes match. Parent directories can be created;
original bytes are never decoded or normalized. New files are published from a
synced temporary file without replacement (Unix permissions 0600). An
interruption before publication leaves no partial destination; an abrupt process
exit may leave a hidden `.notes-create-*.tmp` file, which is not a source note.

Every open core workspace holds a shared OS lease in application state. The
lease uses the native root identity when available, falling back to its canonical
path. It coordinates cooperating updated processes sharing the same data
location. Older binaries, separate application data directories, and third-party
editors do not participate. Use the same workspace path as the app. External
saved edits are checked using BaseRev/hash; this is not a transaction against an
uncooperative external writer changing the filesystem at the publication instant.

`application.json` is a separate bounded schema-1 checkpoint. Preflight checks
must succeed before a durable revision intent is stored; source writes happen
only afterward. If the write succeeded but its receipt was lost, retry accepts
the exact intended bytes without rewriting them. Differing newer content blocks
retry. A successful local receipt records remote revision, local identity and
observed BaseRev; it is persisted before advancing the application cursor. If
later work in a batch fails, earlier receipts remain committed. Inspect `status`
for progress and preserve the received queue on any error.

`applied_revisions` counts successful historical local receipts. `applied` is
true only when that count is nonzero and equals the received count. It is **not**
a live disk scan or an assertion that later local edits match the remote. These
receipts are distinct from server `stored: true, applied: false` responses; the explicit command below reports them to the server.

This closed-workspace command refuses renames, tombstones and local divergence.
The later sections describe editor application (0.20.6) and explicit uploader
resolution (0.20.7); neither bypasses these source guards. Do not delete drafts or local
notes merely to bypass a refusal. Core tests cover byte preservation, failed
intent persistence, interrupted receipt recovery, drafts and a real second
process holding the workspace open. Client tests cover checkpoint progress,
collisions, local edits, incompatible state and rename refusal; the native TCP
and HTTPS smoke tests exercise explicit application followed by a local conflict.

## Device application acknowledgments (0.20.3)

After applying received notes, explicitly report the durable receipts:

```sh
notes-sync-client acknowledge /private/receiver-state /private/integration.secret
notes-sync-client status /private/receiver-state
```

The command requires a receive-mode client and sends at most 20 receipts in
application order. Each successful echoed response advances a durable
`acknowledged` cursor in `application.json`. `acknowledged_revisions` in status
counts confirmed historical receipts; it is not a live disk assertion. Cached
content, exports and an unfinished write intent never qualify. Application and
transfer remain offline-capable/separate operations; neither sends receipts.

The authenticated `POST /v1/workspaces/{workspace}/sync/acknowledgments` endpoint
accepts the pinned workspace UUID, device UUID and one applied revision UUID.
It requires Read and whole-history path visibility. The first accepted receipt
binds a device to that credential ID; another credential cannot claim that
device. Token replacement with a new credential ID requires future explicit
rebinding support; preserve state instead of changing the device UUID by hand.
There is no remote proof of disk contents: receipts are authenticated client
assertions and do not by themselves invoke deletion, pruning or automatic recovery.

Exact retries are idempotent. A lost response or local checkpoint failure leaves
the same receipt pending; retry sends it again without touching source notes.
An older ancestor after a newer acknowledgment is refused, preserving the
server's progress. An older server backup can use the explicit 0.20.15
recovery below. Restoring an older client backup still requires future
reconciliation support. No automatic rollback or reset
is attempted. Revocation, workspace mismatch, hidden/out-of-scope history and
unknown revisions are refused. Existing server request/body limits apply; the
journal allows at most 1,024 acknowledging devices and evicts none.

Server receipts and device owners are atomic with the existing vault and survive
its offline backup/restore. Existing vaults default to no owners/receipts;
existing application checkpoints default to zero acknowledgments. Once written,
the new fields are intentionally refused by older binaries rather than silently
lost. Keep the updated binaries and both state directories during recovery.
ADR-048 records the boundary. Tests cover lost responses, restart, batch bounds,
legacy checkpoints, unapplied/local-conflicting content, ownership, monotonicity,
scope, revocation, backup/restore and the real CLI over the TCP/HTTPS smoke path.


## Exclusive open-session core foundation (0.20.5)

This section records the 0.20.5 Rust host API; the 0.20.6 app integration is below.
The CLI continues to require a closed workspace. Ordinary app sessions remain
shared; opening a prepared receive queue now explicitly selects the exclusive
session described below. Version 0.20.5 supplied only the core host API.

A host can call `WorkspaceService::open_sync_workspace` before opening any
buffers. This acquires the same exclusive activity lease used by offline apply
and holds it until closing the workspace. A second cooperating process cannot
open that root using the same app data. An already-open session cannot upgrade:
it must first be closed through the normal draft-preserving workflow. Failed
exclusive admission leaves no open workspace and does not change later shared
admission. Existing ordinary app/MCP behavior stays shared.

`sync::apply_in_workspace` accepts the existing service, the received path and
bytes, the previous local receipt, retry intent, and a snapshot of **every live
buffer**, including inactive panes. Each snapshot contains note identity,
observed BaseRev, buffer version and saved version. The host must stop editing,
settlement, navigation and workspace switching for the complete operation and
reload. Core cannot discover omitted frontend buffers.

Before calling the durable-intent callback, core rejects changed buffers,
suspended notes, duplicate snapshots, stale disk revisions and any draft entry.
It then uses the same collision, byte-preservation, atomic-write and registry
protocol as offline apply. Dirty buffers are never flushed or discarded to make
sync proceed. Successful application invalidates the quick-open path index;
`reload_note` gives the host the clean document, current revision and encoding
profile without closing its workspace. Refresh affected clean buffers before
resuming editing, including recovery after an uncertain source write. Persist
the returned receipt separately; a successful source write is not a server ack.

The new tests cover clean application/reload, dirty inactive and stale clean
buffers, unchanged source on failed intent, draft preservation, refusal of shared
sessions and competing owners, and lease release at close. The existing
cross-process and offline recovery tests run against the shared implementation.
No frontend interaction or installed-app acceptance is claimed by these tests.


## Apply a received queue in the app (0.20.6)

Use the existing CLI to initialize a **receive** queue and transfer revisions.
Close the current workspace in the app, choose **Open received workspace**, and
select that queue's state directory (the folder containing `client.json`). The
app opens the queue's bound source using its actual app data directory and an
exclusive core session. A queue already pinned to another app data directory is
refused. No token or server URL is entered into the app by this workflow.

Choose **Apply received revisions** to apply at most 20 creations/same-path
updates. Transfer and `acknowledge` remain explicit CLI operations; transfer can
populate the cache while the workspace stays open, and a busy client lock causes
application to refuse rather than overlap. Restarting the app restores a normal
shared workspace; close it and reopen the receive queue to resume this mode.

The current editor holds one live buffer (ADR-030). Inactive tabs hold positions,
and Split shows that buffer beside its preview. The app snapshots that complete
buffer inventory and refuses dirty, writing, draft or conflict state. Pending
IPC and active IME composition prevent admission. Once admitted, ordinary IPC,
input, CodeMirror document changes, autosave and reconciliation are gated until
reload is verified. Existing dialogs must be closed before applying.

The client reuses durable per-revision intent and receipts. It advances the
observed buffer BaseRev between revisions of the same note within a batch.
After success **or partial failure**, it reloads clean documents through core and
returns their content/profile/revision together with the outcome. The frontend
installs the reload only into the exact frozen clean buffer, then refreshes the
tree and resumes reconciliation. Earlier receipts survive a later refusal.

An IPC failure has an unknown outcome. Editing stays paused and **Retry safe
reload** reads through the same service mutex before input is released. Failed
or missing reloads keep the barrier in place; the UI never treats a missing
response as proof that nothing was written. After recovery, apply again to
resume the durable checkpoint. No draft is saved/discarded merely to enable sync.

Renames, tombstones, editor conflict controls, broader pairing, credentials/UI transfer,
scheduling and automatic acknowledgments remain queued. This delivery adds app
controls for prepared receive queues, not a complete sync settings interface.

Validation for 0.20.6: the full local `tools/check.sh` gate passed on macOS with
`RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`, including native/Windows clippy, workspace tests, TCP
smoke, byte preservation, generated types and frontend tests/build. ENOSPC is a
Linux-only check. Client regressions cover multiple updates to one open note,
partial receipts and dirty refusal; frontend regressions cover blocked input,
uncertain responses, failed/missing recovery reloads, pending IPC and composition.
The isolated Tauri development process launched, but the native automation
surface did not expose its unbundled window. This is not installed GUI or owner
acceptance; those checks remain open.

## Explicit divergent resolution (0.20.7)

Version 0.20.7 introduced resolution of divergent, live revisions of the same
note at the same path. Version 0.20.8 adds the explicit choices described below. `fetch` receives one page without publishing, so a rejected
outbox cannot block inspection of the peer. `conflicts` compares the saved local
head with the received history; it does not capture dirty or unsaved buffers.

```sh
notes-sync-client fetch /private/sender /private/token.secret
notes-sync-client conflicts /private/sender
notes-sync-client export /private/sender REMOTE_UUID
notes-sync-client export /private/sender LOCAL_UUID
notes-sync-client resolve /private/sender LOCAL_UUID REMOTE_UUID /private/chosen.md
notes-sync-client transfer /private/sender /private/token.secret
```

Fetch repeatedly for histories longer than 20 publications. Both UUIDs must be
the currently observed heads in this queue. The result file supplies the exact
chosen bytes, including its encoding and line endings. `resolve` only stages a
publication: it does not write the source folder or contact the server. Keep the
saved source consistent with the chosen result before staging again; `stage`
continues to capture the actual saved files as new edits. No automated source
replacement follows from resolving an upload queue.

The publication has both heads as parents and `expected` remains the observed
remote head. An optional `branches` array retains original divergent revisions
and their content, in parent-before-child order. Imported branches cannot become
heads independently: all must belong to the same note and lead to the other
parent of the resolution. The two parents must diverge. The transaction checks
the full graph, hashes, path collisions and authorization for every imported
edge before persisting anything. A hidden historical path, missing mutation
permission or stale head refuses the entire envelope. No clock selects a winner.

At most 20 branch revisions and 8 MiB of aggregate decoded content (branches plus
result) fit one envelope. All revisions count toward the server's 10,000-revision
limit, and retained content counts toward its 32 MiB bound. Pages retain their
append cursor: only the final resolution is a new publication; fetching it
returns the retained branches too. Receivers import their history, apply only the
accepted result through existing source guards, and acknowledge that result.
`export` can recover retained branch bytes by UUID as well as pending/received
results; it still refuses to overwrite an existing private export file.

A race leaves the staged resolution intact. Fetch the new remote head and make
another explicit choice; the former resolution and its branches are retained
inside the replacement envelope. A lost response retries the same UUID and
bytes, even after restart. No pending bytes are removed before the replacement
client state has been persisted atomically.

Linear publication JSON is unchanged. Upgrade server and clients before sending
resolutions: older readers reject the nonempty `branches` field rather than
silently dropping history. Keep a backup of operational state before downgrading.
Version 0.20.9 adds closed-workspace receiver conflict handling below. Conflict
UI remains queued; confirmed broader pairing is available in 0.20.12 below. Explicit rename/delete choices follow. HTTP and client tests
cover stale races, lost receipts, restart, branch scope/hash rejection and source
application; TCP/HTTPS smoke exercises the actual CLI commands end to end.

## Rename and deletion choices (0.20.8)

After `fetch` and `conflicts`, the uploader can choose an explicit final path
and bytes, or choose a tombstone, for divergent revisions of the same note:

```sh
notes-sync-client resolve-to /private/sender LOCAL_UUID REMOTE_UUID notes/final.md /private/chosen.md
notes-sync-client resolve-delete /private/sender LOCAL_UUID REMOTE_UUID notes/final.md
notes-sync-client transfer /private/sender /private/token.secret
```

`resolve-to` covers rename/edit, rename/rename and delete/edit by choosing both
the final workspace-relative Markdown path and the exact result file bytes.
An empty result file is a live empty note, not a deletion. `resolve-delete`
explicitly chooses a tombstone with no content. Both commands require the two
observed heads and retain the original divergent history. The old `resolve`
command still refuses renamed or deleted heads because it has no explicit path
or deletion choice. Missing files never implicitly request deletion.

The client checks paths, graph identity, known path collisions and current local
and received heads before staging. The server still checks the current remote
head and all branch permissions atomically: resurrection needs Create, path
changes need Move, and tombstones need Delete. Update permission remains needed
for imported live edits. A failure retains the queue; unknown receipts retry the
same revision. No new wire format is introduced beyond the 0.20.7 envelope.

These commands only stage history. They do not rename/delete source files or
apply received filesystem operations. Before `stage` again, bring the saved
source into agreement with the chosen result: an existing file is captured as a
new edit or resurrection, and a missing file remains reported rather than
implicitly deleted. Ordinary receiving application still stops before a rename or tombstone and
retains its checkpoint. Explicit receiver conflict choices apply these effects
in 0.20.12 below; general history replay and cycles remain queued. Same-path
receiver conflicts are handled by the 0.20.9 workflow below.

Regression tests cover live/deleted remote heads with both live/tombstone
choices, colliding and hidden destinations, legacy refusal, lost receipts,
restart and unchanged source bytes. HTTP tests prove Create/Move/Delete cannot
be bypassed through a resolution. The TCP/HTTPS smoke runs both new CLI commands
and verifies receiving application still refuses unsupported filesystem changes.
The expanded smoke respects the existing per-credential request window.

## Saved receiver conflicts (0.20.9)

A receive queue can preserve a saved local edit when a later remote revision
blocks normal application. Close the workspace in every cooperating app using
the same app data directory; preserve any drafts first. Fetch the remote history,
then capture the conflicting note by its **remote note UUID**, shown by `received`.
The core checks the previously applied local identity, reads the exact saved
bytes under an exclusive session, and refuses missing/changed identities, drafts,
open workspaces and a different app data directory. It never infers identity from
path alone. The local note must remain live at its previously applied path. Remote
renames/tombstones can be resolved by explicit restoration there (0.20.10).

```sh
notes-sync-client fetch /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
notes-sync-client received /private/receiver
notes-sync-client capture-conflict /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data NOTE_UUID
notes-sync-client conflicts /private/receiver
notes-sync-client export /private/receiver LOCAL_UUID
notes-sync-client export /private/receiver REMOTE_UUID
notes-sync-client resolve /private/receiver LOCAL_UUID REMOTE_UUID /private/chosen.md
notes-sync-client transfer /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
notes-sync-client apply-resolution /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data RESOLUTION_UUID
notes-sync-client apply /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data
notes-sync-client acknowledge /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
```

Capture stores one durable local branch and its observed source revision in
`client.json`; it does not change the application receipt. An unresolved capture
cannot be uploaded as a winning linear revision. `resolve` retains both parents
and all original bytes, using the same server compare-and-set as an uploader.
A write-capable credential is required to publish; an existing read-only receive
credential gains no permissions. `resolve-to` may choose bytes at the same path;
0.20.12 also applies explicit tombstone and new-path results in a closed workspace. One captured conflict
is handled at a time; after its application, another saved conflict can be captured.

`apply-resolution` applies only a resolution already fetched back from the server.
It checks the original captured BaseRev, acquires the exclusive session again,
and persists a separate resolution intent before the atomic source write.
Later local edits refuse application and remain untouched. Keep the source stable
until this workflow finishes. In 0.20.11, `recapture-conflict` explicitly preserves
newer saved bytes and requires a new choice; it never selects a winner automatically.

Intermediate received revisions of this note must be ancestors of the chosen
result; they may include remote renames and tombstones. They are recorded as **superseded**, never written to the
source and never acknowledged as applied. Interleaved publications for other
notes are recorded as **deferred**; ordinary `apply` processes them before newer
queue entries, using its original 20-item batches and revision guards. They may
also be applied through the prepared-queue app session after the conflict has
been resolved. A further conflict in a previously applied deferred note can be
captured and resolved independently. No unrelated publication is discarded.

Application metadata records the resolution intent, superseded positions and
deferred positions atomically with the receipt. A crash after source persistence
retries the same result without rewriting matching bytes; normal application and
new capture refuse an unfinished resolution intent. Deferred ordinary writes use
the original durable intent protocol. `acknowledge` stops at deferred work,
skips superseded positions and inspects at most 20 positions per call.

`applied_revisions` and `acknowledged_revisions` count actual historical receipts,
not consumed queue positions. `superseded_revisions` counts replaced intermediate
versions; `deferred_revisions` counts unprocessed interleaved versions. `applied`
is false while deferred work exists and is still not a live scan of disk content.
These additive fields require updated clients; older readers reject new state
rather than silently discard capture/recovery metadata. Back up operational state
before upgrades or downgrades.

Tests cover source preservation, identity mapping, open-session/draft refusal,
later edits, lost publication replies, resolution and deferred-write recovery,
interleaved notes, repeated captures and the absence of false acknowledgments.
TCP/HTTPS smoke exercises capture, resolution, transfer, application and receipts
through real CLI processes. Editor conflict controls and unattended recapture remain queued; owner acceptance is separate.


### Restore after a remote rename or deletion (0.20.10)

When the remote moved or deleted a note while its receiver copy was edited,
`capture-conflict` still anchors the saved local bytes to the last actual local
application. Explicitly choose to keep a live note at that applied path:

```sh
notes-sync-client resolve-to /private/receiver LOCAL_UUID REMOTE_UUID original.md /private/chosen.md
notes-sync-client transfer /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
notes-sync-client apply-resolution /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data RESOLUTION_UUID
notes-sync-client apply /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data
notes-sync-client acknowledge /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
```

Use the same capture/export steps above first. `original.md` must be the actual
previously applied relative path, not a newly selected destination. The ordinary
`resolve` command refuses a renamed or deleted remote parent because keeping a
path or resurrecting a note requires an explicit choice. Both histories remain
available; superseded remote moves/deletions cause no local filesystem effects
and receive no application acknowledgments. Other files at the remote path stay
untouched. Server history collision and permission checks still apply, including
Move/Create/Delete permissions required by the retained edges.

The source must still match its captured identity and BaseRev. This supports
restoring the edited receiver copy, not accepting a remote move/deletion as a
local filesystem operation. Explicit recapture and local rename/delete effects are described below.


### Recapture newer saved receiver edits (0.20.11)

If the source changes again after capture, preserve the newer saved bytes with:

```sh
notes-sync-client recapture-conflict /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data
notes-sync-client conflicts /private/receiver
notes-sync-client resolve /private/receiver NEW_LOCAL_UUID REMOTE_UUID /private/new-choice.md
notes-sync-client transfer /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
notes-sync-client apply-resolution /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data NEW_RESOLUTION_UUID
notes-sync-client apply /private/receiver /actual/notes-app-data
notes-sync-client acknowledge /private/receiver /private/write-token.secret
```

For remote moves/deletions use `resolve-to` at the applied path as above. Recapture
works before preparing a resolution, or after a prepared resolution has been
published and fetched back. If a resolution is still pending in the outbox,
finish `transfer` first (including retry after a lost response). This preserves
the earlier choice in remote history without writing it to the source. A stale
remote head may require fetching and resolving that pending choice first.

The command appends a child of the previous captured branch, retaining its bytes
and earlier captures. Even when a prior resolution was published, the newly
captured source is not implicitly treated as having applied that resolution.
Application receipts remain unchanged until the new explicit choice is applied.
Old results cannot bypass the new capture. Export retained revision UUIDs to
inspect earlier versions; exports still refuse to overwrite existing files.

Keep the workspace closed and use the same actual app data directory. Unchanged
bytes, drafts, a different local identity/data directory, an already applied
capture or an unfinished application intent are refused. Recover the pending
application intent before any recapture. The normal aggregate byte and branch
limits remain enforced; recapture reserves a branch slot for resolution. At the
limit, queue state and source bytes are preserved. Resolve/publish before adding
more captures rather than discarding history. Older clients reject the extended
capture ancestry; back up operational state before changing client versions.


### Apply an explicit receiver move or deletion (0.20.12)

After capturing a saved receiver conflict, `resolve-to` can choose a new relative
path and result bytes; `resolve-delete` can choose a tombstone. Publish and fetch
the choice with `transfer`, then run `apply-resolution` with the actual app data
directory while the workspace is closed. Parent directories of a move target
must already exist. Hidden/invalid paths, occupied destinations, drafts and
changed source identity/BaseRev are refused before recording intent.

A move creates the result at the destination without replacement, then removes
the guarded original. These are recoverable steps, not one atomic rename. The
durable resolution intent permits restart after destination creation or source
removal, and the local note identity follows the move. A retry accepts only the
intended destination bytes; an external source change blocks removal. A deletion
removes the guarded source through the filesystem adapter. OS trash availability
is not guaranteed: original captured bytes remain in the sync history and can be
exported even when the adapter reports permanent removal.

Application records a tombstone receipt only after removal succeeds. A retry
following a lost final receipt does not remove another file or send duplicate
progress. Intermediate remote revisions stay superseded, and unrelated work
stays deferred. The prepared-queue editor operation still supports ordinary
creations/updates only; these effects use the closed-workspace CLI. Automatic
capture/application of arbitrary renames/deletions and rename cycles remain
separate queue work.

### Pair a subfolder or reconcile existing folders (0.20.12)

Use a credential whose single workspace scope exactly matches the selected
remote subfolder, with review disabled. That server directory must exist when
the scoped credential is issued. Paths below that scope map to paths
relative to the local root; the local root is the selected folder itself.

```sh
notes-sync-client init-subfolder /private/queue /local/folder https://notes.example.net team shared /private/token.secret
notes-sync-client fetch /private/queue /private/token.secret
notes-sync-client pair-preview /private/queue /actual/app-data
notes-sync-client pair-confirm /private/queue /actual/app-data /private/token.secret CONFIRMATION
notes-sync-client transfer /private/queue /private/token.secret
notes-sync-client apply /private/queue /actual/app-data
notes-sync-client acknowledge /private/queue /private/token.secret
```

Repeat bounded `fetch` calls until no unseen remote entries remain before
confirmation. An unchanged cursor after a fetch means that the current history
is drained. Since 1.8.14 `pair-preview` refuses until then, saying how many
revisions have arrived so far: the queue records the server's `has_more` from
its last fetch, and a plan built from part of the history lists remote notes it
has not seen as local uploads. The desktop app's preview fetches the remaining
pages itself before planning, up to fifty per request. A subfolder cursor counts the server's global append positions,
including filtered entries; it is deliberately separate from received counts.
All publication paths, including retained branches, are translated at transport
boundaries. The credential must match the pinned scope on every connection;
outside-scope files never enter the local queue. Histories that crossed the
credential boundary remain subject to the server's whole-history visibility
rules; changing scope is not an automatic migration.

For whole-workspace reconciliation use `init-receive` instead of `init-subfolder`,
then the same preview/confirmation steps. This workflow operates on a fresh receive
queue, before source application or conflict capture. The preview lists local-only
uploads, remote-only downloads, equal-byte identity links and divergent conflicts.
Its confirmation digest binds the local snapshot, remote cursor/workspace,
endpoint, root and app data. Confirmation rereads local identities/bytes and checks
that the server has no unseen entries. Close cooperating editors for confirmation.

Equal-byte links confirm the observed local source as the remote head, without
rewriting it; older versions are superseded without false receipts. Local-only
files are staged for upload and retain guarded local baselines for later receipt.
Remote-only files remain deferred for normal application. Acknowledgments describe
confirmed source state, not mere transfer. The pairing bootstrap and pending
publications are saved atomically; retries use ordinary application intents.

Divergent same-path bytes block confirmation. Compare the exported remote bytes
and the local file first. To retain both, explicitly rename the local file to an
unused path, rerun preview and confirm: that file uploads as a separate note and
the remote note downloads at its original path. To link one chosen content version,
make that choice before generating a fresh preview. Nothing is overwritten merely
because file names match. Existing ordinary-application limitations for remote
rename/delete history still apply; pairing does not silently execute those effects.
This is explicit enrollment and reconciliation, not background bidirectional sync.

The 0.20.12 pairing bootstrap and tombstone receipt fields require updated clients;
older readers reject them. Preserve a full operational-state backup for rollback.

## Apply note effects and referenced attachments (0.20.13)

`stage` captures unambiguous source renames. For a closed rename cycle, the
explicit inventory correlates unique native file identities with unchanged
content before reconciling occupied paths. Ambiguous identities, simultaneous
content changes and backends without native identity do not qualify for this
cycle correlation. The outbox orders a cycle through a temporary Markdown path
in the same directory; it never renames the uploader's files.

Missing files still do not silently become deletions. Use the note identity and
exact live head from `status`/`received` to request a tombstone explicitly:

```sh
notes-sync-client stage-delete /private/sender NOTE_UUID EXPECTED_HEAD_UUID
notes-sync-client transfer /private/sender /private/token
notes-sync-client fetch /private/receiver /private/token
notes-sync-client apply-bundle /private/receiver /private/app-data
```

`stage-delete` verifies that the identity is absent from a fresh source inventory.
`apply-bundle` applies FIFO creations, edits, moves and deletions with durable
intent and identity/BaseRev guards. Colliding targets and changed local notes
refuse application. Move destination directories must already exist. A crash
can leave an intermediate cycle path; repeat the command to finish the saved
queue. All cooperating editors must be closed, using the same app-data directory.

Captures include local non-Markdown files referenced by Markdown links/images,
using the shared Markdown parser and the filesystem jail. References resolve
relative to the note, including safe parent traversal within the workspace.
Hidden paths, remote URLs and wiki links are excluded; missing eligible files
refuse capture. Note bytes, line endings and references are never rewritten.
At most 32 attachments are allowed per revision, and the existing 8 MiB decoded
publication limit includes all note, attachment and retained branch bytes.

Attachments carry their path, content hash and exact binary bytes. Scope checks
cover primary and historical branch manifests; publishing a manifest requires
create and update permission. Subfolder transport translates manifest paths.
Binary-only edits produce revisions and can be captured as receiver conflicts.
Pairing refuses divergent attachment bytes even when the Markdown matches.

`apply-bundle` installs attachments before acknowledging the note. Identical
existing attachment bytes can be reused; different bytes require the prior
recorded BaseRev. A local edit blocks replacement. Durable per-file intent and
receipts resume interrupted bundles; multi-file application is not atomic, so
some attachments may be present before a later note precondition fails. The
editor's prepared-queue action and plain `apply` refuse attachment bundles.

Retained branch attachments can be recovered without source writes:

```sh
notes-sync-client export-attachment /private/receiver REVISION_UUID attachments/image.png
```

The command creates a private non-overwriting `.bin` export and prints its path.
Unreferenced attachments are never automatically deleted. Background scheduling,
editor bundle controls, broader retention and device acceptance remain open.

## Desktop background transfer and controls (0.20.14)

Expand **Device sync** above the editor. New pairing selects the local folder,
a private operational queue outside it, a pre-provisioned credential file outside
notes, the server/workspace and optional subfolder scope. Credentials are read
by Rust; the webview receives no token bytes. HTTPS and the existing explicit
private-network exception retain their validation, DNS pinning and no-redirect
rules. The app reuses operator-managed token files; it does not create accounts
or store tokens in notes, the webview or settings.

Choose sending to an empty inbox, receiving into an empty folder, or reconciling
existing folders. Sending captures local saved files. Receiving/reconciliation
fetches a preview; confirmation binds the actual local identities and refuses
divergent note or attachment bytes. Close the workspace before previewing or
confirming. If enrollment succeeds but its first fetch fails, reconnect the
created queue and retry transfer; do not initialize the same directory again.
Large inboxes may need multiple bounded passes before confirmation succeeds.

The active connection and schedule are persisted in private app data as
`sync-control.json`; other queue directories remain intact and can be reconnected.
Automatic transfer defaults off. Intervals range from 120 to 3600 seconds.
A native worker serializes transfers outside the editor mutex while the app
process exists, including while its controls are collapsed. Network/power hints
are refreshed by the host; missing or older-than-45-second observations pause
transfer. Unknown network or battery status also pauses unless explicitly
permitted. The UI never assumes that missing battery APIs mean AC power, or
that Wi-Fi is unmetered. A suspended host may pause; the worker does not promise
OS wakeups, execution after quit, or mobile background execution.

Each pass is bounded to 48 transport requests plus credential validation, with
existing page/content limits and checkpointed progress. Transient failures back
off exponentially up to one hour; no timestamps choose conflict winners. Power
and network conditions are checked between requests. **Pause transfer** disables
the persisted schedule and cancels between requests without waiting for the
editor mutex. An already sent request may finish; its outcome remains resumable.
Offline edits remain ordinary local files. Upload queues capture them on a
permitted pass. Receive queues report changed local files as pending; publication
of their edits remains the explicit conflict workflow when a remote branch
exists. Pairing reconciliation does not enable automatic bidirectional capture.

The status distinguishes disabled, offline, pending, syncing, up-to-date,
conflict and error. Received-but-unapplied content is pending, not up-to-date.
Transfers never apply files in the background. Use **Apply received files** with
the workspace closed, or the existing barrier-protected editor action for
supported plain-note updates. Acknowledgment uses only durable application receipts.

History lists up to 200 recent revisions with retained branches and attachment
exports. A saved local receiver edit can be captured; newer edits can be
recaptured without discarding earlier bytes. Choose a resulting Markdown file
and path, or explicitly choose deletion, then stage the two-parent resolution.
Transfer that revision before applying its published result from history. Path
collisions between unrelated identities require distinct paths; the UI does not
silently merge them. Original byte exports remain private and non-overwriting.


### Explicit older-server recovery (0.20.15)

Pause all device schedules and other publishers during this maintenance operation.
Keep backups of the stopped server and client state. Restore the server backup
with its original workspace UUID and credentials, then use an **unscoped** queue
that retains the missing publications:

```sh
notes-sync-client recover-server /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
```

The command compares every server publication, including retained branches and
attachment bytes, with the corresponding local received publication. Only an
exact prefix is accepted. It replays at most twenty missing publications with
original UUIDs, expectations and bytes, then audits the prefix again. Repeat
until `replayed_publications` is zero. The CLI waits 61 seconds on server Busy
responses and retries each request at most twice, allowing full-history audits
to cross normal rate-limit windows without weakening server limits. Large audits
can take several windows. Other failures stop immediately; rerun after fixing
the cause. Lost responses preserve the same idempotent operation.

When the complete retained history is present, the command re-sends the latest
previously acknowledged application receipt for each note. Newer application
receipts remain pending for the normal `acknowledge` command. It does not replay
older acknowledgments, reset application counters, change outbox/cursor state,
write notes or attachments, or infer application from server storage. Existing
read/write permissions and device-to-credential bindings still apply. A read-only
credential cannot restore missing publications. Each device that needs to restore
its acknowledgments should recover while its retained history still covers the
server prefix; recover shorter queues before longer queues. Once a server is
ahead of a queue, fetch normally before retrying recovery.

A different workspace UUID, any divergent prefix, hidden scoped history or a
server history longer than the local received cache is refused. A partial replay
can already have stored valid publications before a later request fails; inspect
and retry the same queue. The audit is not a server-wide transaction, so keep
other publishers paused until recovery completes. Unreceived publications lost
from both the server backup and all device queues cannot be reconstructed.
Broader retention/pruning, older-client reconciliation and automatic rollback
recovery remain open.

Validation covers bounded replay, restart after a lost storage response, a lost
application response, tombstones, binary attachments, divergent/corrupt history,
foreign workspace UUIDs, scoped/incomplete queues and unchanged local edits.
The native TCP smoke restores an actual offline backup, recovers from two
original CLI queues including retained conflict branches, and checks exact
server publications and unchanged local application receipts. These are desktop
process tests, not physical mobile lifecycle or owner acceptance.


### Saved receiver publications (0.20.16)

A receive queue can capture a saved edit to an already applied live note without
inventing a remote conflict. The source path and local identity must match its
receipt, all received work must already be applied, and the cooperating workspace
must be closed and draft-free. Capture retains original bytes and referenced
attachments in the durable outbox, parenting the publication to the applied head.
Missing paths and new notes are not automatically published.

```sh
notes-sync-client stage-receiver /absolute/queue
notes-sync-client transfer /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
notes-sync-client confirm-receiver /absolute/queue
notes-sync-client acknowledge /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
```

Staging captures at most one note per call. Publishing uses the existing CAS,
permissions, scope and retry rules. Confirmation performs guarded reads of the
note and attachments and saves a receipt for bytes already present; it never
rewrites user files. If a later edit exists, confirmation refuses and preserves
it. After the earlier publication has been fetched, another staging call captures
that newer edit as its successor. Intermediate captures not confirmed on disk
receive no application acknowledgment. A pending ordinary capture must first be
published; explicit recapture refuses to replace that outbox entry.

Remote divergence still requires the existing explicit two-parent resolution.
Choosing a resolution disables automatic confirmation for that capture; applying
the result remains an explicit action. History retains both branches and assets.
A received successor from another device still requires explicit application.

Desktop transfer settings have a separate **Publish saved edits** option,
disabled by default, including for settings saved before 0.20.16. When enabled,
each admitted transfer pass stages at most one saved receiver edit, transfers its
outbox and confirms the published capture before sending actual acknowledgments.
Network/power admission, request budgets and pause behavior remain unchanged.
The worker captures only when a pass runs; it does not journal every keystroke or
promise background execution on mobile. Open editor sessions block capture until
closed. Turning capture off prevents new automatic captures/confirmations;
publications already queued retain their ordinary transfer semantics.

The optional capture marker is backward compatible when reading older queues.
Older binaries may refuse queues written with the new marker; preserve state and
use the current version instead of deleting the field. No pruning is introduced.

Validation covers lost storage responses, restart, edits during transfer,
attachments changed before confirmation, source modification-time preservation,
explicit conflict resolution, ignored new/missing paths and open-workspace
refusal. Controller tests exercise the separate opt-in and repeated saved edits;
the native/HTTPS transport smoke sends an edit back from a scoped receiver and
applies it on another receive queue. UI tests check the default-off setting.
New notes and recognized renames are covered by the independent opt-ins below.
Deletion remains deliberately outside automatic capture: a missing tracked file
does not publish a tombstone. Physical mobile lifecycle validation remains
queued.


### New notes and recognized receiver renames (0.20.17)

Receiver capture now has three independent choices: saved same-path edits, new
notes, and recognized renames. Each defaults off in transfer settings, including
when reading settings from an earlier release. Enabling saved edits alone does
not publish new files or rename revisions. Each transfer pass still captures at
most one change, under closed-workspace, identity, draft and size guards.

A new local note becomes a fresh remote note identity with no parent revision.
Its actual local identity is retained separately for confirmation and later
edits. Missing tracked notes block new-note capture, since an unrecognized move
must not silently become a duplicate identity. Remote path collisions retain the
outbox and both files; capture does not overwrite or choose an owner. A nonempty
received cache must be explicitly applied first. An empty receive queue can bind
application data without any file effects; the desktop does this when new-note
capture is enabled. CLI users can bind it with an initial empty `apply` call.

```sh
notes-sync-client apply /absolute/queue /absolute/app-data
notes-sync-client stage-receiver-new /absolute/queue
notes-sync-client transfer /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
notes-sync-client confirm-receiver /absolute/queue
```

For renames, the core correlates a closed inventory with its existing identities.
Only a recognized note at a different path is captured. The publication retains
its remote note identity and uses the last applied head as its parent. Occupied
remote destinations are refused. Missing notes are never inferred as deletions.
Recognized rename cycles preserve the same identity one move at a time;
ambiguous identity changes and path-collision resolution remain explicit refusal
paths. Markdown references are not rewritten; referenced attachments must be
readable at the new path and are captured with their actual bytes.

```sh
notes-sync-client stage-receiver-renames /absolute/queue
notes-sync-client transfer /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
notes-sync-client confirm-receiver /absolute/queue
```

Confirmation reads the current source and updates receipts without moving or
rewriting files. A new note edited after publication is recaptured as a successor.
With rename capture enabled, a second recognized move after publication is also
retained before confirmation; superseded intermediate revisions get no false
application acknowledgment. An unpublished pending change is transferred first,
never mutated in place. A divergent remote revision still requires explicit
resolution. Later changes not yet confirmed remain protected by the source guards.

The capture's prior applied revision is optional for a new causal root. Existing
queues with a prior revision deserialize unchanged; older binaries may refuse
new-root captures and must not be made to load them by deleting state fields.
Server publication format, permissions, scope and retention policy are unchanged.

Tests cover empty enrollment, original-byte/attachment retention, lost receipts,
new-note edits during transfer, identity-preserving rename cycles, a second move
before confirmation, independent desktop options, draft/open-workspace refusal,
retained path collisions and a missing tracked file that creates no tombstone.
The controller test uses the same application-data directory as an open desktop
workspace, confirms capture is refused without publishing, then verifies two
renames retain identity and an eventual deletion remains unpublished. Native and
HTTPS smoke tests publish new scoped notes and renames from one receiver and
explicitly apply both on another device.


### Restored client queue recovery (0.20.18)

`recover-client` explicitly audits a queue restored from an older backup
against the current server. Pause publishers and the desktop scheduler
while recovering, and keep the original backup. Restore the queue and its bound
application data consistently; mixed snapshots whose receipts refer beyond the
cached history are refused. Pending pairing is refused.

```sh
notes-sync-client recover-client /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
```

Each call compares every retained publication, including original bytes,
attachments and imported branches, with the same ordered server sequence. For
an unscoped queue that sequence is the complete prefix. For a scoped queue it is
the credential-visible sequence; invisible positions are skipped while the
absolute server cursor is retained. The credential scope must still match the
queue's pinned scope on the connection. The command then recovers at most one
20-position server page of further visible publications. Repeat until
`recovered_publications` is zero. A matching pending publication is removed only when the complete
publication is identical to the server copy. Unpublished changes and local
branches remain intact, including conflicts. The command makes only read requests;
it never republishes, resets cursors, edits source files, changes application
receipts, or acknowledges remote revisions. The existing transport permissions,
rate limits and retry policy apply.

Shorter visible, foreign, divergent or corrupt server history is refused without
saving partial progress. Out-of-scope publications are neither fetched nor
treated as divergence. Each successful batch is saved atomically under the queue lock.
An interrupted audit can be repeated after restart. Recovery is cache/outbox
reconciliation, not a repair of lost file identities or stale application receipts.
If application data was rolled back while source files advanced, ordinary guarded
application can still refuse; preserve those files and resolve that mismatch
separately. No timestamp chooses a winner. Restored application identity
reconciliation is an explicit local operation described below. A scoped queue still cannot prove a
complete server prefix for `recover-server`, so server recovery remains unscoped.

### Interrupted two-device effects (0.20.18)

The recovery suite now reconstructs the durable boundary after a receiver rename
or deletion reached disk but before its application receipt was saved. A new
client instance replays the intent, confirms the effect without rewriting the
moved file, and retries a lost server acknowledgment. A file recreated at the
original path blocks replay and is preserved. Existing local receipt checks remain
in force; no production fault-injection switch was added.

The real native TCP and Compose HTTPS smoke runs the same move/delete receipt
loss with separate CLI processes, checks exact bytes and modification times, then
restores an older uploader queue and recovers its published history without
changing either source folder. These are deterministic persisted-state crash
boundaries, not an operating-system kill at an instruction. Physical mobile
suspension/resumption and installed-release owner acceptance remain open.

### Device-confirmed resolved-branch pruning (0.20.19)

The first retention slice removes exact bytes only from divergent branches that
have already been consumed by a published resolution. It retains the branch
revision metadata inside that resolution, including paths, hashes, parents and
tombstones, so causal ancestry, current heads and integer page cursors do not
change. The chosen resolution bytes and all ordinary linear publications remain
available. This is deliberate partial retention, not general history deletion.

Stop the server, take an offline backup, and run:

```sh
notes-server sync-prune WORKSPACE
```

The local operator command refuses while the server or a backup holds the
instance lock. A resolution becomes eligible only when every device known to the
workspace has acknowledged that resolution or a causal descendant for the same
note. A device with no qualifying receipt blocks it, including a revoked device;
revocation does not erase historical safety evidence. With no known devices,
nothing is pruned. The JSON report states resolutions and decoded payload bytes
pruned, revision metadata retained and known-device count. Repeating the command
is idempotent. The operation is unavailable over HTTP and grants no credential
new authority.

The server persists the compacted vault atomically and validates the entire graph
before replacement. Backup/restore retains the compacted form. A publisher that
lost the original storage response may retry its authorized pre-prune envelope;
the server recognizes its exact compacted form without restoring the bytes or
rewinding the head. A client cannot publish metadata-only history itself. Older
clients reject a fetched compacted envelope because the additive `history` field
is unknown; use 0.20.19 or later after server pruning.

After the server prune, each applied receive queue can explicitly compact its
matching local copy:

```sh
notes-sync-client prune-client /absolute/queue /absolute/credential.secret
```

The queue checks its durable local acknowledgment cursor, constructs the exact
metadata-only form, and fetches the server envelope before saving anything. A
mismatch, unresolved branch or locally unacknowledged resolution stays unchanged
and exportable. Each invocation compacts at most 20 resolutions and reports
decoded bytes removed. It makes read requests only, does not alter application
receipts, and never reads or writes source files. Later revisions still fetch and
apply through the retained graph. Run it for every retained receive queue after
the server operation; uploader queues keep their original recovery payloads.

Tests cover multiple devices at different causal positions, a tombstone after a
resolution, an original-envelope retry after pruning, stopped-server enforcement,
vault backup/restore, client/server mismatch, branch export removal and continued
receive application. Linear publication content, current resolution bytes,
whole-log cursor compaction and automatic scheduling remain queued.

### Device-confirmed linear payload retention (0.20.22)

The same offline `sync-prune` operation now also compacts acknowledged,
strictly linear non-head publications. The publication remains at its original
append-log cursor and its revision metadata remains in the causal graph; only
its bytes and attachments are removed. The current live head remains intact as
the baseline for a newly enrolled receiver. A fork, merge, tombstone head,
missing receipt or zero known devices prevents this compaction.

Receive queues compact only after fetching the exact server envelope. A newly
enrolled receiver advances through pruned causal entries without touching its
folder, then applies the retained current payload. This preserves cursor
positions and ancestry while avoiding reconstruction from removed bytes.

### Restored application identity reconciliation (0.20.23)

When application data was restored independently from a fully applied receive
queue, use this local command after preserving the original backup:

```sh
notes-sync-client reconcile-application /absolute/queue
```

The command is available only to a receive queue with no pending publications,
capture, deferred application, or interrupted application effect. It re-observes
each current, non-deleted receipt through the restored application data and
requires the file bytes and base hash to equal that receipt's immutable remote
revision. It then replaces only the operational local `NoteId` and `BaseRev`
stored in `application.json`, so later guarded updates can continue using the
restored registry.

It never writes a source file, changes the queue or cursor, contacts the server,
or acknowledges a revision. A changed, missing, deleted, unresolved, or
incompletely applied file is refused with the checkpoint left unchanged. Resolve
the local change first; the command does not select a winner by timestamp.

The native TCP and Compose HTTPS smoke tests run this sequence through two real
client processes, then continue with guarded move and delete effects using the
restored application data. They assert the original source bytes stay untouched
during reconciliation.

### Explicit device retirement (0.20.20)

An abandoned device no longer has to block retention forever. With the server
stopped, first list the workspace registrations:

```sh
notes-server sync-device-list WORKSPACE
```

The JSON rows identify the device UUID, owning credential UUID, whether that
credential is revoked, and how many per-note receipts it retains. Confirm the
device is no longer in service, take an offline backup, revoke its owning
credential, and then run:

```sh
notes-server sync-retire-device WORKSPACE DEVICE_UUID
```

Retirement is refused while the server or backup process holds the instance
lock, when the device is unknown, or while its owning credential remains active.
It atomically removes only that device's owner binding and application receipts;
all revisions, payloads, tombstones, heads, cursors and other devices remain.
The success is audited as `sync_device_retire` and reports the removed receipt
count and remaining device count. It is not exposed over HTTP.

**Revocation, unlike retirement, can be done from a device** (ADR-096, from
1.8.66). A credential the operator granted `devices` reads
`GET /v1/workspaces/{w}/sync/devices` — each device, its owning credential's
label, its receipts, whether that credential is revoked, and whether it is the
caller's own — and `POST /v1/workspaces/{w}/sync/devices/{device}/revoke`
revokes the owning credential of **another** device, taking effect on that
device's next request. Its own device answers `409 own_device`, a device outside
the workspace `404`, and a credential without the permission `403`. Revocation
deletes nothing; retiring the revoked device, which does, stays the stopped-server
operator act above.

Retirement is permanent operational intent. Restoring the pre-retirement backup
restores the registration; otherwise a returning device must be paired as a new
device under a new credential and reconcile normally. If retirement leaves no
known devices, `sync-prune` still removes nothing. Tests cover active-owner
refusal, stopped-server locking, revoked ownership, preservation of another
device, repeat refusal and the pruning device count.

## Connection test (1.3.8)

`sync_control_probe` asks the server what a credential is for and reports which
step answered. It takes the server address, the credential file and the
private-address permission — **not a workspace name**, because the name is what
it exists to discover.

It is the only remote call that runs with a workspace open, and it takes no
lock. It writes nothing, reads no client state and touches no note, so the
reasons pairing waits for a closed workspace do not apply to it; holding the
operation mutex would only mean that a transfer already running turns a
diagnostic into `Busy`, at the moment somebody most wants to run it.

The outcomes are `address`, `credential_file`, `credential_shape`,
`unreachable`, `refused`, `unexpected` and `granted`, each a different thing for
the owner to go and fix. `granted` carries the workspace name, the scope, the
permissions and the review flag. The HTTP status is reported when something
answered, because `401` and `502` send the owner to different machines.

**Every check is the function `Remote::connect` calls.** A test that approves
what the transport would refuse is worse than no test, because it moves the
search for the cause to somewhere the cause is not; `Endpoint::validate`'s
address half, the credential file checks, the address policy and `decode` are
each called from both. The transport still collapses them into `Invalid`,
`Offline` and `Denied` — that is the right shape for something that retries and
must not narrate what it found in a secret file, and the wrong shape for a
person asking whether the thing works.

`unexpected` is the one worth naming: the address resolves, a web server
answers, and what answers is not this API. On a host that already serves other
sites that is the default virtual host, and it is otherwise indistinguishable
from a bad credential.

The app fills an empty **Server workspace** field from `granted`, and reports a
disagreement rather than overwriting a field the owner typed. The frontend maps
the outcomes through a `Record<SyncProbeOutcome, string>`, so a variant added in
Rust fails the TypeScript build instead of rendering its own key.
