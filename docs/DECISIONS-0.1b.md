## D-01 — The Windows cross-check runs by default, and installs its own target

**Decided.** `tools/check.sh` no longer skips the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` clippy
step when the target is not installed: it runs `rustup target add` once and then
runs the step. `NOTES_NO_WINDOWS_CHECK=1` opts out on purpose; a machine missing
`rustup`, the target, or the MinGW C compiler that bundled SQLite needs degrades
to a printed warning rather than failing the gate.

**Gap closed.** The step existed at `0.7.3` and was conditional, which meant the
one check that would have caught both Windows compile failures was absent on
exactly the machines that had never run it — a developer who has not added the
target is precisely the developer who needs the check. A gate that opts itself
out silently is not a gate.

**Why the warning rather than a failure** when `rustup` is missing: the step
guards a cross-compilation concern, and refusing to run `cargo test` and the
byte-preservation suite over it would trade a real check for a hypothetical one.
The line is loud and names the reason.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Make the missing-target case fatal (one
`return 1` becomes `exit 1`), or move the cross-check out of `check.sh` and rely
on the Windows CI leg alone — which is what cost two rounds at `0.7.2` and
`0.7.3`.

---

## D-02 — The `.continue/` pointer to `ARCHITECTURE.md` was repaired in place

**Decided.** `.continue/README.md` linked `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the repository
root, where it has never lived. The link now points at `../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
and the words "at the repository root" are gone.

**Gap closed.** A queue index whose links do not resolve fails at the one job the
index has.

**Why this is not a breach of the queue rule.** The `QUEUE-RULE` block forbids
editing queue *material* as tidying — the specifications of things that do not
exist yet. `README.md` says of itself that it is "the one file here that is not
queue material… the folder's index", and this change edits a pointer rather than
a specification. It was authorised explicitly for this pass.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Move `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to the repository
root, which is what the link asserted. It was rejected: `docs/repodocs.md` maps
where documentation lives, and one document promoted to the root for the sake of
one stale link would break that map instead.

---

## D-03 — The full disk is a size-capped `tmpfs` in a user namespace, not a loopback mount

**Decided.** `tools/enospc.sh` creates an unprivileged user namespace
(`unshare -U -r -m`), mounts a 1 MiB `tmpfs` inside it, and runs
`notes-core`'s `tests/enospc.rs` against that directory via `NOTES_TINY_DIR`. It
runs in `tools/check.sh` and on the Linux leg of CI. Acceptance criterion 5 of
0.1a moves from *partly met* to **met**.

**Gap closed.** [`ACCEPTANCE-0.1a.md`](ACCEPTANCE-0.1a.md) §5 — the classifier
was unit-tested for errno 28, but nothing exercised the path from a filesystem
that is really out of room to a `SaveResult::WriteFailed` and a draft holding the
buffer. Two steps sat in that gap: `write_atomic` returning `Err` at the right
moment, and `settle` writing the draft rather than propagating.

**Why not the loopback filesystem** the manual recipe described. `mount -o loop`
needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` in the initial namespace — root, in practice `sudo` — so
automating it meant deciding what CI runners are allowed to do, and a developer
running the gate would be prompted for a password by a lint script. The
acceptance document called this "a decision about CI privileges rather than about
this milestone", and it was right; the resolution was that **no privilege is
needed**. Any user may create a user namespace, `tmpfs` is mountable inside one,
and a `tmpfs` over its size limit returns ENOSPC exactly as a full disk does —
the kernel does not have a second, more authentic ENOSPC. The mount is private to
the namespace, so a failed run cannot leave a filesystem mounted on anybody's
machine, which the loopback recipe could.

**What it does not cover.** EDQUOT: a quota cannot be arranged this way, so
`IoKind::classify`'s unit test stays the only evidence that a quota reads as
`DiskFull`. And the *visible* half — the status bar saying "no space left" — is
still asserted in the core rather than observed on screen, along with everything
else the window owes.

**Amended at `0.9.1`: both mechanisms, in the order that needs the fewest
privileges.** The GitHub runner turned out to be the hardened-kernel case this
decision had already anticipated — Ubuntu 24.04 ships
`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`, and `unshare -U -r` fails with
*"write failed /proc/self/uid_map: Operation not permitted"*. It is also the one
machine with passwordless `sudo`. So `tools/enospc.sh` tries the user namespace
first and falls back to `sudo -n mount -t tmpfs`, and **`NOTES_REQUIRE_ENOSPC=1`
on the CI leg turns "no mechanism available" into a failure** — a runner that
lost both would otherwise skip in silence, which is exactly the failure mode
D-01 exists to refuse. `sudo -n` never prompts, so a developer machine with a
password falls through to a loud skip rather than stopping the gate to ask for
one.

The reasoning above is unchanged and is why the order is what it is: the
privilege-free path is the one a developer runs, and the privileged one exists
because a specific machine forbids the other.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Drop the fallback and mark criterion 5 *partly
met* again on any kernel that restricts user namespaces; or drop the namespace
path and require `sudo` everywhere, which is what the original manual recipe
did and what this decision was taken to avoid.

---

## D-04 — The preview corpus is golden files, blessed and then **read**

**Decided.** `fixtures/markdown/` holds `NAME.md` with `NAME.html` and
`NAME.doc.json` beside it, compared byte for byte with no normalisation.
`NOTES_BLESS=1 cargo test -p notes-markdown` rewrites them from the renderer.

**Gap closed.** "Fixtures do preview antes do parser: markdown de entrada com a
saída HTML esperada ao lado." A prose description of expected output cannot fail
a build.

**Why blessing exists, and why it is not the same as accepting.** Hand-authoring
the exact bytes `pulldown-cmark` and `ammonia` produce — attribute order, where
the newlines fall inside a table — is guesswork, and a first commit of thirty
hand-written goldens is thirty diffs against incidental formatting rather than
against the contract. So the inputs and the **contract** are written first
(`fixtures/markdown/README.md`, one row per file), the goldens are generated, and
then every one is read against that table before the commit. A golden blessed
without being read records a bug as if it were a decision, which is the only
failure mode a corpus like this has.

**That reading was not ceremonial.** It caught four defects on the first pass,
each of which the test suite would have frozen: `outra.md#uma-secao` lost its
fragment; `<alguem@example.com>` was classified as a *relative path* and rendered
as a note link to a file with an `@` in its name; a refused image dropped its alt
text and left an empty paragraph; and a bare `https://…` in prose was not
linkified at all, which scope §8.1 lists among the GFM features.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Hand-author the goldens and forbid `NOTES_BLESS`
— the comparison is unchanged, only how the expected file is first written. Or
normalise whitespace before comparing, which makes the corpus tolerant of a
`pulldown-cmark` upgrade and blind to a real change in output.

---

## D-05 — `RelPath` accepts `""` on the wire, and `parse` still refuses it

**Decided.** `TryFrom<String> for RelPath` maps the empty string to
`RelPath::root()`. `RelPath::parse` is unchanged and still returns
`PathError::Empty`.

**Gap closed.** A defect from 0.1a, found while wiring this crate: `RelPath::root()`
**serialises** to `""` and `try_from` **refused** `""`, so the type could not
deserialise a value it produces. The frontend's `ROOT` is that string, and
`tree_list` takes a `RelPath` — every listing of the workspace root was rejected
by argument deserialisation before the command body ran. It is the sidebar's
first call on every launch.

**Why here rather than in `parse`.** `parse` reads something a user typed, and an
empty name is not a path; relaxing it would let `note_create(dir, "")` through to
a collision check. The wire form is a different question with a different answer,
and `RelPath` already has two constructors for exactly that reason.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Give the root its own wire value — `"."`, or a
`Option<RelPath>` on every command that can take it. Both cost a change to every
signature that names a directory, and `"."` is a segment `parse` refuses on
purpose.

---

## D-06 — `mailto:` is refused, because the scope and the capability file both say so

**Decided.** A `mailto:` link, and an email autolink `<alguem@example.com>`,
render as **text**. Only `http` and `https` become anchors.

**Gap closed.** Scope §8.4: *"Links externos `http(s)` abrem no navegador do SO
por clique. Outros esquemas recusados."*

**Why not make an exception.** `shell:allow-open` in
`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` is restricted to `{ "url": "https://**" }`
and `{ "url": "http://**" }`. Rendering a `mailto:` anchor would therefore
produce a link that does nothing when clicked — worse than text, because it
looks like it works. Making it work means widening a capability, and **granting
the agent a permission is the owner's act** (CLAUDE.md golden rule 7): written
into the capability file with its reason, never applied on the way past.

**The email autolink is the same decision wearing a different hat.**
`pulldown-cmark` reports `<alguem@example.com>` with the scheme stripped, so
without this rule it was classified as a relative path and rendered as a link to
a note called `alguem@example.com`. The golden corpus caught it.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Add `{ "url": "mailto:*" }` to `shell:allow-open`
and change one match arm in `notes-markdown/src/url.rs`. The capability edit is
yours to make; the code half is two lines.

---

## D-07 — Exactly one attribute is force-set on `<input>`, because `ammonia` reorders the ones it forces

**Decided.** `ammonia` forces `type="checkbox"` on every `<input>`; `disabled`
and `checked` are allowlisted rather than forced.

**Gap closed.** A flapping golden. Forcing both `type` and `disabled` made
`fixtures/markdown/tasklists.html` differ between runs of the same code:
`ammonia` lifts a forced attribute out of its position and re-appends it while
iterating a `HashMap`, whose order is per-process. With one forced attribute the
output is fixed; with two it is a coin toss, and a byte-exact corpus would have
been abandoned as "flaky" rather than read as the real finding it is.

**What it costs.** An `<input>` written by a note in a workspace that has opted
into raw HTML comes out as an **enabled** checkbox rather than a disabled one.
That is the whole difference, and it carries nothing: `name`, `value` and every
`on*` attribute are dropped, `<form>` and `<button>` are refused outright, so
there is nothing to send and nowhere to send it. The task-list markers the
application itself renders always carry `disabled` — the writer emits it and the
golden pins it.

**Why it was found here and not in review.** The suite ran green three times
before the corpus was committed; the failure only appeared when `cargo test`
happened to run the golden target in a process whose hash seed ordered the map
the other way. A test that is byte-exact turns "occasionally different" into a
red build, which is the argument for byte-exact comparison rather than against
it.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Force both and normalise attribute order before
comparing — the corpus then tolerates any future reordering, including one that
matters. Or drop `<input>` from the allowlist entirely and render task markers
as a `<span>` with a glyph, which loses the semantics a screen reader uses.

---

## D-08 — The preview serves raster images only; SVG waits for a decision

**Decided.** `notes-asset://` serves `png`, `jpg`/`jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `bmp`
and `avif`, and refuses everything else with `Unsupported`. There is a 64 MiB
ceiling on a single asset.

**Gap closed.** Scope §8.4 says *"Imagens: só relativas ao workspace, formatos
suportados"* and never names the formats. This is the list.

**Why SVG is not on it.** An `<img>` cannot execute the script inside an SVG —
the specification forbids scripting in that context — so admitting it would
probably be safe. *Probably safe because of a browser rule* is a different thing
from *safe by decision*, and the format is a document rather than a picture. A
user who wants a diagram in a note can use a raster export today; a user who
loses their notes to a WebView quirk cannot undo it.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Add `("svg", "image/svg+xml")` to `IMAGE_TYPES`
in `notes-core/src/preview.rs`. The asset response already carries
`default-src 'none'; sandbox` and `nosniff`, which is the second layer that
would make it defensible; the ADR should say so.

---

## D-09 — `shell().open` stays deprecated rather than migrating a capability on the way past

**Decided.** `shell_open` keeps `tauri_plugin_shell`'s deprecated `open`, under
an `#[allow(deprecated)]` that names the reason. Its `http(s)`-only check is in
the Rust as well as in the capability file.

**Gap closed.** Clippy's `-D warnings` gate, which the deprecation would
otherwise fail.

**Why not migrate.** `tauri-plugin-opener` is the successor, and adopting it
means a new dependency **and** replacing `shell:allow-open` with
`opener:allow-open-url` in `capabilities/default.json`. Scope §19 sends a change
that touches permissions or a central dependency to the owner rather than
letting an agent make it in passing, and CLAUDE.md's golden rule 7 says the same
of granting permissions. The scope of what may be opened is identical either
way, so nothing is lost by waiting.

**Alternative if you disagree** — the whole change, for whoever makes it:
add `tauri-plugin-opener` to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `.plugin(tauri_plugin_opener::init())`
in `lib.rs`, swap the `shell:allow-open` block in `capabilities/default.json` for
`opener:allow-open-url` with the same two `url` entries, and replace the body of
`shell_open` with `app.opener().open_url(&url, None::<&str>)`. The scheme check
above it stays either way: the capability is what the WebView may ask for, and
that check is what the process will do.

---

## D-10 — A duplicate is `nome (copy).md`, in ASCII, in every language

**Decided.** `entry_duplicate` writes `nome (copy).md`, then
`nome (copy 2).md`, and the word does not change with the interface locale.

**Gap closed.** Scope §17's 0.1b criterion *"criar/duplicar nunca sobrescreve
destino existente"* needs a name to write to, and the scope does not give one.

**Why not `(cópia)`.** A filename that follows the interface language gives the
same folder different names on two machines — the workspace is meant to be
carried between them, put in Dropbox and cloned from Git, and a duplicate made
on a Portuguese machine and one made on an English machine would be two files
that mean the same thing and sort apart. The scope set the precedent itself:
§12's resolution writes `nome (local).md`, not a translated word. ASCII also
keeps the name portable to a filesystem that stores NFD.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Change the `"copy"` argument in
`duplicate_entry` — the helper already takes the word, because
`nome (local).md` uses the same machinery. Making it locale-dependent means
passing it from the frontend, which is the change you would have to accept along
with it.

---

## D-11 — The trash is the `trash` crate, and a failure degrades loudly

**Decided.** `LocalFs::delete` calls `trash::delete` when `caps.trash` says the
backend has a bin, and falls back to a permanent delete when it does not or when
the call fails. `DeleteOutcome` always says which happened, and the frontend
shows a different sentence for each.

**Gap closed.** `docs/DECISIONS-0.1a.md` D-08 recorded `Permanent` at 0.1a with
"no trash crate yet", and `ARCHITECTURE.md` §11 promises a bin per backend.

**Why the fallback exists at all.** A removable exFAT stick has no bin, a
network share has no bin, a container with no session bus cannot reach the
freedesktop one, and none of those is a reason to refuse a delete the user
asked for. Scope §7.7 forbids the fallback being **silent**, not the fallback:
"deleted permanently — this filesystem has no trash" is a different sentence
from "moved to the trash, so it can be put back", and the user gets whichever
one is true.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Refuse the delete when the trash is
unavailable and make the user confirm a permanent one. It is defensible and it
is more clicks on every removable drive; the sentence above is the cheaper way
to keep the same promise.

---

## D-12 — The debouncer is ours; `notify` 8, not the 9 release candidate

**Decided.** `notes-fs/src/watch.rs` wraps `notify` 8.x with a 200 ms debouncer
of about forty lines. `notify-debouncer-full` is not a dependency, and `notify`
9 (a release candidate) is not either.

**Gap closed.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8's first pipeline stage.

**Why not the release candidate.** This is the component that tells the
application a file it is holding has changed underneath it. Its behaviour on a
backend nobody here can test — FSEvents, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` — is the wrong
thing to be finding out from a user's bug report.

**Why our own debouncer.** It is forty lines and it feeds a self-write filter
that is ours anyway. The whole job is *collapse a burst into a set of paths that
may have changed*; every decision after that is the reconciler's, and the module
is explicitly allowed to over-report because the reconciler `stat`s and hashes
before it believes anything. A dependency here would add a second opinion about
event semantics with no second benefit.

**Alternative if you disagree.** `notify-debouncer-full` replaces `watch.rs`'s
thread and gives rename pairing for free — which §8 lists as a normalisation
step this implementation does not do, because identity correlation (§9) answers
the same question from the disk rather than from the event stream, and does it
correctly when the event is missed.

---

## D-13 — A full scan does not announce files nobody has opened

**Decided.** `ChangeKind::Created` is emitted only for a **hinted** path — one
the watcher just reported. A full scan reports modifications, removals and
correlated moves, and says nothing about a file that is merely absent from the
registry.

**Gap closed.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8's table says `Removed / Created → identity
correlation, then registry update`, written against a registry that knows every
file. This one does not: it is populated when a note is **opened**
(`DECISIONS-0.1a.md` D-09), so on a full scan every note the user has never
opened is "unknown".

**What it fixed.** The first run of `tests/reconcile.rs` reported the entire
fixture workspace as `Created` on every scan, and blew the hash budget with
events that were not changes. Announcing a thousand creations each time a window
regains focus is worse than saying nothing.

**Nothing is lost.** A scan re-lists the tree anyway, which is what the sidebar
needs; and a file that appeared as half of a rename is found by correlation,
which walks the tree for exactly that.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Keep a set of paths reconciliation has seen —
a second registry, persisted, with its own staleness — and diff against it. It
buys "a file appeared while the app was closed" as an event rather than as a
listing, which nothing currently needs.

**Decided.** Log the window lifecycle (`CloseRequested`, `Destroyed`,
`Focused`) from `src-tauri`. Do **not** change the file-dialog backend yet, and
record why.

**What is known.**

The owner ran the application, clicked *Open Folder…*, and the window vanished.
The process exited **`0`**, with an empty `stderr` beyond the startup line. That
is not a crash: no panic, no signal. Tauri ends its event loop when the last
window is gone, so an exit of `0` means **the window was destroyed and the
application shut down normally** — which is what a parent window being taken
down with its child dialog looks like from outside.

What the dependency tree says, and it is consistent with that reading:

| Evidence | Reading |
|---|---|
| `ashpd` is **absent** from `Cargo.lock` | `rfd` 0.16 is using the **GTK3 backend directly**, not the XDG Desktop Portal |
| `rfd` pulls `raw-window-handle`, `gtk-sys`, `gobject-sys` | the chooser is parented to the Tauri window — `transient-for` |
| `busctl --user` lists ten portal services and `gtk.portal` is installed | the portal **is available on this machine and is not being used** |

So the configuration in play is a GTK3 file chooser parented to a `GtkWindow`
that also hosts a WebKitGTK WebView, sharing one GTK main loop. When the chooser
is destroyed, the parent following it produces precisely the observed signature.

**What is not known, and why it is not claimed.**

**It did not reproduce under automation.** The window could not be raised on this
window manager — `xdotool windowactivate` returns `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW failed`,
and neither `windowraise` nor `wmctrl -a` moves it — so synthetic clicks landed
on whichever window was in front. An earlier claim in this session that the
failure had been "reproduced" was wrong for that reason, and is corrected here
rather than left standing. Two runs that opened the chooser programmatically,
without a click, both survived.

A mechanism consistent with the evidence is not a proven one, and changing the
dialog backend to fix a failure that cannot be triggered on demand would leave
nothing to verify the change against.

**The instrumentation is the deliverable.** `CloseRequested` and `Destroyed` are
indistinguishable from outside the process and answer different questions: the
first says something asked the window to close — a window manager, a person, or a
`transient-for` parent following its child — and the second says it was
destroyed outright. The next occurrence names which, and that is what a second
attempt needs.

**The workaround, written down so it is not rediscovered.** Force `rfd` onto the
portal by declaring it in `apps/notes-app/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`; Cargo unifies
features, so `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s own `rfd` picks it up:

```toml
rfd = { version = "0.16", default-features = false, features = ["xdg-portal", "tokio"] }
```

The portal runs the chooser **out of process**, so no GTK parenting is involved
and the failure cannot occur by this mechanism. Its costs are real, and are why
it is not applied blind: it changes behaviour on every Linux desktop, it returns
portal-mediated paths, and with no portal running there is no GTK fallback — the
picker would stop working for a user who has no symptom today.

**Alternative if you disagree.** Apply the workaround now and treat the absence
of further reports as evidence. That is defensible for a symptom this severe; it
is not measurement, and this entry says which is which.

**A note that invalidates a different test.** The environment those runs
inherited already carried `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER` — from the terminal
application, traced at `1.6.86`, and not from any shell file, which matters
because it means the variable follows *how the application was launched* rather
than *who launched it*. `linux.rs` correctly refuses to override a value the user
set, and logged *"left alone — already set"* on every run above. **Milestone 0.0's first acceptance criterion was therefore not
exercised by any of them**, and `docs/SPIKE-0.0.md` now says so.
