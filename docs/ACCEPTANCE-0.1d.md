# Acceptance — milestone 0.1d (Interface)

> **Status:** `ACTIVE` · Implementation was delivered in `0.13.0`; this is its
> remaining acceptance, and **almost all of it is a person's**. 0.1d produced very
> little core code and a great deal of frontend, at a point where this project's
> testing strength is in the core — so the automated half is narrow and honest
> about being narrow, and everything else has a box with nobody's tick in it.
>
> **Nothing here is ticked, and a box is not ticked by whoever built it.** The
> rule the owner set for this milestone and every one after: a flow becomes
> `verified` when they have walked it **in an installed build** and then
> **repeated it on the following release**. A flow that worked once on a machine
> that had just compiled it is a smoke test with a good mood.

## 1. The interface, area by area

The ten interface areas, in the order the eye meets them.

| # | Area | Expected | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | **The rail** | Files and Search each show their panel; clicking the icon of the panel already open collapses the sidebar; Settings opens the panel; **Graph is visibly disabled and its tooltip says 0.3** | ☐ |
| I2 | **Explorer toolbar** | New note creates *and opens* it; new folder appears; sort flips A→Z / Z→A and directories stay first; collapse-all folds every open directory | ☐ |
| I3 | **Workspace selector** | The footer shows the current workspace; the menu opens with *Open folder…*, *Create workspace…*, recents and *Close workspace* — and each of the four does what it says | ☐ |
| I4 | **Workspace selector, with a dirty buffer** | *Close* and switching both ask, **in the application's own modal**, and name the note; declining leaves the workspace exactly as it was | ☐ |
| I5 | **Tabs** | The active tab is distinguishable **by background**, not by weight; the dirty dot appears; `×` closes; `+` makes a note; the split button toggles | ☐ |
| I6 | **Note header** | Back and forward move through the notes visited, and grey out at the ends; the title is the file name without `.md`; the toggle swaps Source and Preview; `⋮` opens | ☐ |
| I7 | **The column** | The text sits in a centred column with margins that grow with the window; switching Source ↔ Preview does **not** move the text under your eye | ☐ |
| I8 | **The split divider** | Dragging resizes; double click and `Enter` even it up; **`Tab` reaches it and the arrows move it** | ☐ |
| I9 | **Status bar** | The state, the words and the characters — **and nothing else**. No backlink count | ☐ |
| I10 | **Focus** | Every menu and modal returns focus to the control that opened it; the focus ring is visible on every control, on every surface | ☐ |

### Interface that shipped after this document was written

0.1d was delivered at `0.13.0` and this table stopped there, while interface kept
arriving. These six are walked the same way and by the same rule — an installed
build, then repeated on the following release.

**Only one of them wants a phone, and even that one does not need it.** The
drawer is decided by window width, not by platform, so dragging a desktop window
narrower than 720px is the whole setup for I11–I13 — and doing it that way is
better than a device, because the boundary is what is being checked. I15 and I16
are desktop chrome and want no setup at all.

| # | Area | Expected | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| I11 | **Narrow window, at the boundary** | Narrow the window below 720px: the sidebar stops being a column and overlays the editor with a dimmed scrim behind it; the editor takes the whole width underneath; split view stacks one pane over the other instead of side by side. Drag back: everything returns to columns, with nothing left overlapping | ☐ |
| I12 | **The drawer hands the screen back** | Narrow, with the drawer open, click a note in the tree: the drawer closes and the note is in front of you. **Wide, the same click must not close the sidebar** — that is the app fighting you, and it is the half of this behaviour most likely to be got wrong | ☐ |
| I13 | **The Markdown row** | Narrow, with a note open: a row of six sits under the editor — bold, italic, heading, list, link, code. Each applies to the selection; pressing the same one again **undoes it**; link leaves the caret on `url` so typing replaces it; one press is one `Ctrl+Z`. Wide, the row is not there at all | ☐ |
| I14 | **A backend that cannot replace a file in one step** | Not walkable on a local folder, and that is correct: `LocalFs` is atomic on every platform, so the banner stays invisible until a SAF tree or another backend answers otherwise. It is listed here so that the first person who opens such a workspace knows the banner is expected rather than a bug | ☐ n/a |
| I15 | **Help ▸ About** | It is a dialog of *ours*, not the platform's empty one, and it states four things: the version running, the engine, the data directory and the open workspace — *none open* in words rather than a blank row. `Copy` puts the same lines on the clipboard as the ones on screen; paste them somewhere and compare. This is the dialog a bug report is built from, so a wrong version here is worse than no dialog | ☐ |
| I16 | **The chrome is not selectable text** | Drag across the rail, the tab strip, the status bar, a tree row and an open context menu: **nothing highlights**. Then drag across the editor and the preview: they highlight, because they *are* the document. The bug this replaces looked like a colour problem — a screenshot with every context-menu item lit at once — and was a stray text selection painting the labels | ☐ |

**Measured on 17/09/2026, against everything that shipped after `0.13.0`.**
I11–I14 came from the mobile block of `1.6.14`–`1.6.17`; I15 and I16 came from
applying the same measurement to the rest, and are desktop. Nothing else since
`0.13.0` adds an interface flow: `1.1.31`'s fault was an unresolved i18n key,
which the gate now catches by itself and which is in the table above rather than
here; `1.2.0` and `1.3.7` change what a rename and an update *do*, not what the
interface shows, and are accepted where that behaviour is.

### The test that cannot be automated

> *"Alguém que usa Obsidian todo dia abre o app e encontra tudo sem pensar. Se
> precisar procurar onde troca de pasta, o marco não fechou."*

☐ — and this one is the owner's alone.

---

## 2. Automated

Automated behavioral coverage complements the owner walk; it does not replace it.

| What | Where | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Menu keyboard navigation, with focus tracked | `src/app/Menu.test.tsx`, 14 tests, in a DOM | Arrows wrap; a disabled item is never landed on; `Home`/`End`; `Enter` runs and closes; **`Escape` and `Tab` return focus to the trigger**; a click outside closes; closing is requested before the action; choosing restores the trigger before the action runs; a launched dialog returns focus there; an action can focus its own destination |
| Modal keyboard behavior | `src/app/DialogHost.test.tsx`, 6 DOM tests | Enter activates the focused button, including Cancel; Tab wraps in both directions; text selection and submission; Escape restores focus; confirmation opens without an input-method exception; modal keystrokes do not invoke background shortcuts |
| Welcome creation | `Welcome.test.tsx` | Initial workspace naming modal is mounted and usable; cancellation makes no create call |
| Settings/palette focus and asynchronous results | `modal.test.tsx`, `Palette.test.tsx` | Modal Tab trapping/restoration; Quick Open refreshes while its path cache builds |
| Divider lifecycle | `Divider.test.tsx` | Keyboard bounds/reset and drag cursor cleanup on unmount |
| The drawer's one decision | `src/stores/ui.narrow.test.ts`, 4 tests | Collapses only when narrow; leaves a wide window alone; asks `matchMedia` for the **same query string** the stylesheet opens its mobile block with; does nothing where there is no `window` to measure |
| One drawer breakpoint | `tools/check.sh`, step `one drawer breakpoint` | Reads the query out of `stores/ui.ts` and fails unless `styles.css` opens its mobile block with that exact query. CSS cannot read a TypeScript constant, so this is what keeps the number single |
| About states four facts | `About.test.tsx`, 4 tests | Version, engine, data directory and open workspace; *none open* rather than a blank row; `Copy` copies the same lines it shows; the engine is read from the user agent and never calls WebView2 WebKit |
| Every `t("…")` resolves | `tools/i18n-keys.py`, in `check.sh` | The old check compared the two catalogues against **each other**, so a key missing from both passed — which is how a dialog came to ask for a name under the label `tree.newNote.prompt`. It now resolves every literal against both, and replaced the parity check rather than joining it |
| Markdown row actions | `src/editor/markdown-actions.test.ts`, 14 tests | Wrap and unwrap from either side; a second press undoes the first from the state the first leaves; an empty selection still produces marks; a single mark is not mistaken for a pair; prefixes apply to every touched line and clear only when all of them carry it; the caret never slides behind a prefix; CRLF is left alone |
| Search startup cancellation | `SearchPanel.test.tsx` | A late start response is cancelled after the panel closes |
| Contrast and the palette | `tools/contrast.sh`, in `check.sh` and CI | 42 pairs: AA for every text/surface pair, AA for the focus ring and for disabled controls, an 8/255 sRGB step between the three dark levels — **and a build failure if any colour is written outside `:root`** |
| No blocking dialogs | `tools/no-blocking-dialogs.sh` | A browser script dialog anywhere in the frontend fails the build. Six flows of 0.1b were behind one |
| Switching workspace | `notes-core`, `tests/switch.rs`, 6 tests | Identity survives a switch and a restart; a dirty close is refused **and names the notes**; a clean close leaves no workspace open; every workspace opened is offered again |
| Everything the milestone inherits | `tools/check.sh` | Format, clippy on the native and the Windows target, the whole Rust suite, byte preservation, the full-disk suite, the generated TypeScript, the i18n catalogues, the frontend build and test suite |

**Three things the automated half deliberately does not claim.** It does not
know whether the interface *looks* right; it does not know whether the tab bar
is legible on the owner's screen; and it cannot walk a flow. `tools/contrast.sh`
proves a ratio, not a design.

---

## 3. The twenty-six flows, re-indexed

`ACCEPTANCE-0.1b.md`'s U1–U12 and `ACCEPTANCE-0.1c.md`'s C1–C14, with **the
steps rewritten for the interface they now live in**. The behaviour is
unchanged and the expectations are the originals, word for word where they
still fit — what moved is where you press.

They stay ☐ in all three documents until the walk on the `.deb`. A flow whose
steps describe a window that no longer exists cannot be walked, which is why
they were re-indexed rather than ticked where they were (ADR-037).

### From 0.1b — entry operations, conflicts, preview

| # | Was | Now, in the 0.1d interface | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| U1 | *New note* in the top bar | **Explorer toolbar → the file-plus icon**, or `+` on the tab bar, or `Ctrl+N` | The modal appears, the note is created **and opens**; `Cancel` and `Escape` each leave nothing behind |
| U2 | *New note* → empty name | Same, empty field → **Create** | Refused **in the dialog**, with "A name is required."; the core is never called |
| U3 | *New folder* in the top bar | **Explorer toolbar → the folder-plus icon** | The folder appears in the tree |
| U4 | Welcome → *Create Workspace…* | **Sidebar footer → the workspace name → *Create workspace…*** — and still on Welcome, for the first one | Native picker for the parent, the application's own modal for the name |
| U5 | Right-click a note → *Rename…* | Right-click the row **or its `⋮`** → *Rename* | The tab keeps its cursor and identity; the sidebar shows the new name |
| U6 | Right-click → *Move to…* | Right-click the row **or its `⋮`** → *Move* | The note moves; an **empty field means the workspace root** and must not be read as a cancellation |
| U7 | Right-click → *Delete…* | Right-click the row **or its `⋮`** → *Delete* (last, and marked destructive) | A **destructive** confirm; on cancel nothing happens; on confirm the status line says *trashed* or *permanent* and which |
| U8 | `Escape` on any of the above | Unchanged — **and now also on every menu**, which is what `Menu.test.tsx` asserts and this confirms on screen | Cancels, and focus returns to the control that opened it |
| U9 | *Source* / *Preview* / *Split* buttons in the top bar | **The note header's toggle** for Source ↔ Preview, **the tab bar's split button** for split; `Ctrl+E` still cycles all three | Three modes; `Ctrl+E` cycles |
| U10 | Edit in another editor while dirty | Unchanged | Conflict banner, autosave suspended, and the **compare screen** shows both versions |
| U11 | Resolve the conflict three ways | Unchanged | *Keep mine*, *use the disk*, *save as a copy* — the version not chosen lands in `conflicts/` |
| U12 | `Ctrl+F` inside the note | Unchanged | Matches highlighted, replace applies, `Escape` closes |

### From 0.1c — navigation, search, tabs, settings

| # | Was | Now, in the 0.1d interface | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `Ctrl+P` | Unchanged | The palette lists matching notes, best match first; `Enter` opens it |
| C2 | `Ctrl+P` → no match | Unchanged | Says so; does not close, does not open anything |
| C3 | `Ctrl+P` after creating a note | Unchanged | The new note is offered without restarting the app |
| C4 | `Ctrl+Shift+F` → search a word | **The rail's Search icon**, or `Ctrl+Shift+F` — which now *shows* the panel and never toggles it shut | Results stream in, with path, line and the matching line |
| C5 | Search with unsaved changes | Same, in the sidebar | The panel **says results come from what is on disk** |
| C6 | Cancel mid-search | Same, in the sidebar | Stops; partial results stay on screen and say they are partial |
| C7 | Switch literal ↔ regex | Same, in the sidebar | The mode is named on screen and does not change underneath a running query |
| C8 | Click a result | Same, in the sidebar | Opens that note **at that line** |
| C9 | Open three notes | Unchanged — **and the active tab now has a background**, not just a weight | Three tabs; the active one is marked; `Ctrl+W` closes one |
| C10 | Quit and reopen | Unchanged | Workspace, tabs, **active tab and cursor position** all come back |
| C11 | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Unchanged | Lists commands; `Enter` runs one; `Escape` closes |
| C12 | Settings → the four | **The rail's Settings icon**, or `Ctrl+,` | Each applies to the editor and survives a restart |
| C13 | Switch the language | Same panel | Every visible string changes; no key is left showing raw |
| C14 | Update and restart | **The update banner's *Install and restart*** — which at `1.3.7` started performing the workspace close itself, instead of telling you to find it in the sidebar footer | A dirty note still stops the close and is named; declining installs nothing; after the new version comes up, the workspace, the tabs, the active tab and the caret are all back |

### And one the interface added to the list

| # | Flow | Expected | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| C14 | Settings → **Diagnostics** | Platform and the dmabuf decision, which used to be in the top bar and is now where a thing you look up belongs | ☐ |

---

## 4. Out of this milestone, and not to be found in it

The delivered milestone boundary is part of its acceptance: **graph view**
(0.3), **backlinks and their counter**
(0.3), a properties panel (0.3), themes, plugins, Live Preview (§18), and
anything from 0.2.

The graph icon in the rail is the one place any of this is visible, and it is
`disabled` with `0.3` in its tooltip. If it ever becomes clickable in this
milestone, that is a defect and not a bonus.

---

## 5. What this milestone changed about the core

Almost nothing, on purpose. Two things are
worth naming:

- **`tests/switch.rs`** — six tests over a path that was unreachable until the
  workspace selector existed. They pin behaviour, not a fix: a store-before-adopt
  was written into `open_workspace` and removed again when it turned out the
  tests passed without it (`DECISIONS-0.1d.md` D-01).
- **Nothing else.** Where the interface met a gap in the core it was written
  into `DECISIONS-0.1d.md` rather than fixed on the way past. D-01 is the one
  that matters: `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.1 describes a registry debounce that is not
  implemented, and the day it is, `open_workspace` becomes a loss path.

## 6. Completion pass in 0.14.0

The initial Welcome screen now mounts its own dialog host. Settings and the
palette share focus trapping/restoration; settings errors expose a way to close.
Quick Open refreshes while its cache builds, and cancelling Search during its
start request cannot leave a background search running. A divider unmounted
mid-drag restores the body cursor/selection. Development and bundle versions
are stamped from `version.md` (0.13.4 onward). None of these fixes ticks the
owner's installed-release checks above.

Milestone 0.2 adds a reference review after Rename/Move's destination dialog.
U5/U6 still preserve identity, with that additional explicit step. Its core
changes are tracked in ADR-039 and ACCEPTANCE-0.2, outside the interface-only
boundary of 0.1d.
