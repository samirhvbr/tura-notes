//! The filesystem seam.
//!
//! This crate knows about bytes, paths and capabilities. It does **not** know
//! what a note is, and never touches the registry (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §2) — the
//! separation is what lets `notes-core`'s write protocol be tested against a
//! fake implementation with no disk at all.
//!
//! The trait exists at 0.1a with exactly one implementation behind it. That is
//! deliberate: "a folder the user chose" is a desktop concept, and iOS has no
//! equivalent (ADR-008). Discovering that after the core has been written
//! against `std::fs` is a rewrite of the core.
