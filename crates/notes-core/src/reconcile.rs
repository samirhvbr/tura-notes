//! Reconciliation and identity correlation — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 and §9.
//!
//! **`stat`, then hash. Everything else is a hint.** A watcher event, a window
//! regaining focus, a tab switch and a poll timer all arrive here as the same
//! thing: *these paths may have moved, go and look*. Nothing in this module
//! believes an event; it looks at the disk and compares against the registry,
//! and size-and-mtime alone never conclude anything (scope §12).
//!
//! Two rules run through it:
//!
//! - **A dirty buffer is never overwritten and never silently replaced.** An
//!   external change to a note the user is editing suspends autosave and raises
//!   a conflict; the core cannot write the draft itself, because the frontend
//!   holds the buffer (`docs/DECISIONS-0.1a.md` D-11), so the event says so and
//!   the frontend calls `draft_write`.
//! - **Ambiguity means a new identity.** §9: two candidates on either side of a
//!   rename, and the file gets a new `NoteId`. Re-identifying a note is cheap;
//!   attaching one to the wrong history is not.
