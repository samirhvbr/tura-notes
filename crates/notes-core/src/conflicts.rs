//! Conflict snapshots, and the four ways out of a conflict.
//!
//! Scope §12 names the resolutions — *comparar · manter o meu · usar o do disco
//! · salvar como `nome (local).md`* — and `ARCHITECTURE.md` §17.1 already
//! settled that **"compare" is not one of them**: it changes nothing on disk, it
//! is UI over data the frontend is already holding, and a command that reads two
//! strings the caller has would be a command that exists to be called by a
//! screen rather than to do anything.
//!
//! The other three are here, and each one **keeps the version it is not
//! choosing**. That is the rule the whole module exists for: a resolution is the
//! one moment a user can lose work by answering a dialog quickly, so the answer
//! they did not give is written to `conflicts/` first (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.3).
