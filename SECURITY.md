# Security Policy

> This file exists for **the path GitHub recognises** — a `SECURITY.md` at the
> root is what enables the *"Report a vulnerability"* button. It **does not
> duplicate** the norm; it points at the single source.
>
> **The source is [docs/security.md](docs/security.md), binding from the first
> commit.**

## Reporting a vulnerability

A vulnerability, an exposed secret or a suspected leak: report it to
**samirhv@me.com**, **immediately**. Please do not open a public issue for a
security problem.

You will get an acknowledgement, and a structural fix becomes an ADR in
[docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).

See [docs/security.md §11](docs/security.md#11-incident-response) for the
normative incident-response text, and
[§5](docs/security.md#5-secrets-and-configuration) for why an exposed secret is
**rotated, not reverted** — removing the line from HEAD leaves it in the history
and in every clone.

## Supported versions

**The newest published Release, and `master`.** Nothing older is supported, and
nothing is backported: a fix ships **forward**, as a new `X.Y.Z` with its own
Release, and an installed desktop build receives it through the signed updater
([docs/updater.md](docs/updater.md)). There is no maintenance branch and there
will not be one — `origin/master` is the only branch this project publishes from.

So the answer to *"is my version affected?"* is decided by the version number,
not by a support matrix: if the fix is in `X.Y.Z` and you are below it, you are
affected and the remedy is to update.

## Context

Tura Notes is a **public** repository, and has been since its first commit.

That makes this file the first point of contact for anyone reporting a problem
from outside the house, and it makes the pre-flight in
[docs/runbook.md §6](docs/runbook.md#6-pre-flight-before-making-a-repository-public)
a standing rule rather than a one-off gate: nothing that assumes privacy — a
secret, an internal hostname, a private IP range — ever goes in, because there is
no later moment at which it would be caught. A secret that reaches a commit here
is public from that push, and the response is to **rotate** it, never to delete
the line.
