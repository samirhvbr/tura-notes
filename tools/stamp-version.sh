# Write `version.md`'s version into the places a build reads it from.
#
# WHY: `version.md` is the single source of the version (docs/versioning.md,
# ADR-011), and it is what `tools/release.sh` names the git tag and the GitHub
# Release after. A `.deb` attached to Release `0.11.1` that calls itself `0.1.0`
# is a package nobody can match to the code that produced it, and
# `tauri.conf.json` holds a second copy of the number precisely where that is
# easiest to get wrong.
#
# So the number is not maintained in two places: it is stamped, in CI, from the
# one file that has it. **What is committed is `0.0.0`**, which is valid semver
# and unmistakably not a release — a stale real number in the tree is the thing
# that misleads. `tools/check.sh` fails if the committed value is anything else,
# so a stamped tree cannot be committed by accident.
#
#   tools/stamp-version.sh            # stamp version.md's version
#   tools/stamp-version.sh 1.2.3      # stamp an explicit one

# Norm: docs/versioning.md · docs/decisions.md ADR-035

# © into an escape on top of changing the version. JSON parses both to the
