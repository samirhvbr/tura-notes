## 🔄 Before you start: `git pull`

**ALWAYS** check for remote updates before writing or changing anything in this
repository:

```bash
git pull
```

Working on a stale base creates conflicts. Pull first, always. To inspect
without merging: `git fetch && git status`.

**Fresh clone — enable the hooks ONCE:**

```bash
git config core.hooksPath tools/git-hooks
```

Two hooks then run, and each exists because the other cannot reach its moment:

| Hook | What it checks | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| `commit-msg` | The subject is `X.Y.Z - description in English`; no Conventional Commits prefix, no vague comment | It is the only moment the message exists and the commit does not |
| `pre-push` | `version.md` against the remote default branch — duplicate and monotonicity | It is the only hook that sees the **remote**, and `commit-msg` provably does not run during a rebase, which is how duplicate versions get born |

⚠️ **`pre-push` runs no suite, and that is a choice:** a push that waits four
minutes becomes `--no-verify` the following week, and then the control is dead.
**With no reachable remote it degrades with a warning, never a refusal.** Escape
hatch declared in both, named by `HOOK_ESCAPE_VAR` at the top of each hook —
rename it to `NOTES_NO_HOOK`.

## What this project is

**Tura Notes** — a local-first Markdown note-taking app for Linux, macOS, Windows,
iOS and Android. The user picks a folder; that folder is the workspace; the
`.md` files inside it are the notes.

**Read [docs/product.md](docs/product.md) before changing product behaviour and
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing structure.** The
one-line version of both:

> The files belong to the user, not to the application.

- **Stack:** Tauri 2 · React · TypeScript · Rust · CodeMirror 6 · SQLite.
- **Layout:** `apps/notes-app/` (the Tauri app: `src/` React, `src-tauri/` thin
  shell) · `crates/` (`notes-core`, `notes-fs`, `notes-index`, `notes-markdown`,
  `notes-mcp`, `notes-model`, `notes-sync`, `notes-sync-client` — where the Rust
  logic lives) · `server/notes-server/` (standalone REST process, milestone 0.5).
  [ADR-003](docs/decisions.md#adr-003--the-rust-logic-lives-in-crates-and-the-tauri-shell-stays-thin).
- **Runs locally with:** `cd apps/notes-app && npm ci && npm run tauri dev`.
  Milestones 0.1a–0.1d, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and **0.7** are implemented; 0.4 has its mobile core foundation. Remote MCP answers at `POST /v1/mcp` from the same catalogue, credential and scopes the REST API uses ([MCP-0.7.md](docs/MCP-0.7.md)). The 0.6 blocks provide causal planning, a server inbox and a durable CLI transfer client;
  0.20.1 adds guarded closed-workspace application of creations/updates.
  0.20.3 adds device acknowledgments; 0.20.5 adds the exclusive open-session
  core API. In 0.20.6 the app applies prepared receive queues with an editing
  barrier. In 0.20.7 upload queues support explicit same-path divergent
  resolution with retained branches; 0.20.8 adds explicit path/tombstone choices.
  Version 0.20.9 adds explicit saved same-path receiver capture/resolution;
  0.20.10 restores remote move/delete conflicts at the applied receiver path;
  0.20.11 explicitly recaptures newer saved edits while retaining earlier branches.
  Version 0.20.12 adds recoverable receiver move/delete effects and confirmed
  subfolder/reconciliation pairing.
  Version 0.20.13 adds explicit deletion capture, ordered rename effects and
  referenced attachment bundles with guarded recovery.
  Version 0.20.14 adds opt-in desktop background transport and typed
  pairing/history/conflict controls. Version 0.20.15 adds explicit older-server
  recovery from retained unscoped history. Version 0.20.16 adds saved same-path
  receiver publications and separate opt-in scheduled capture with the workspace
  closed. Version 0.20.17 adds independent new-note and recognized-rename capture.
  Version 0.20.18 adds audited restored-client cache/outbox recovery and
  two-device move/delete receipt-loss tests.
  Version 0.20.19 adds unanimous resolved-branch payload pruning on the server
  and matching receiver compaction. Version 0.20.20 adds explicit revoked-device
  retirement and scoped receiver recovery. The three product questions the 0.6
  gap turned on were answered on 23/09 (ADR-086, ADR-087, ADR-088). Retention is
  now specified and built: doubled limits with their measured cost, and a
  warning from 80% (`SYNC-0.6.md`, 1.8.42). Mobile lifecycle waits on a device
  (R7-08). Device management from the app was accepted on 24/09 (ADR-096): the
  server routes are in 1.8.66 and the app's device panel lists and revokes from
  1.9.0 (R7-04). Owner verification
  on installed releases remains open for **every** delivered milestone — 0.0,
  0.1d, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7, each with its own `ACCEPTANCE-*.md`
  (0.0's walk is §2 of `SPIKE-0.0.md`), none of them ticked.
  The whole gate is `tools/check.sh`; see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
- **Never do, without an ADR that reverses the one named:**
  - store a note anywhere but as a `.md` file on the filesystem, or put the only
    copy of anything the user wrote in SQLite or `.notes/`
    ([ADR-001](docs/decisions.md#adr-001--markdown-files-on-the-filesystem-are-the-source-of-truth),
    [ADR-004](docs/decisions.md#adr-004--notes-holds-only-data-that-can-be-rebuilt-and-must-be-deletable));
  - write metadata into a user's note that the user did not ask for — a file
    opened and not edited comes back out byte-identical;
  - identify a file by path + `modified_at`
    ([ADR-005](docs/decisions.md#adr-005--sync-is-out-of-the-mvp-but-the-file-identity-model-is-not-foreclosed));
  - open a listening port in the desktop app
    ([ADR-007](docs/decisions.md#adr-007--the-desktop-app-opens-no-network-port-by-default));
  - touch `.git/` inside a user's workspace
    ([ADR-006](docs/decisions.md#adr-006--git-is-not-a-dependency-and-not-a-feature-in-the-first-versions)).

**Milestone numbers in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) are not repository
versions.** `0.3` there is a product stage; `0.3.0` here is whatever
`version.md` says.

---

## Golden rules

1. **`.continue/` is the queue · `docs/` is what has been produced ·
   `CHANGELOG.md` is the history.** The exit condition, what "produce" means and
   why length is not one of them are in the **`QUEUE-RULE`** block below. That
   block is regenerated from the fleet standard and is the source — **do not
   restate it here.** The local restatement it replaced is
   [ADR-009](docs/decisions.md#adr-009--an-item-leaves-continue-only-when-it-has-been-built),
   kept as the record of where the decision was made, not as a second copy of it.
2. **In a contradiction, an `ACTIVE` document in `docs/` wins — a `PROPOSED` one
   does not.** A `PROPOSED` document describes something that has not been built,
   so the queue is the authority on intent for as long as both exist.
3. **Every prescriptive document declares its status** on the first lines:
   `ACTIVE` · `HISTORICAL` · `PROPOSED` · `DEPRECATED` · `NOT ADOPTED`. One
   with no declaration is read as `ACTIVE`, which is exactly the failure mode.
4. **A document made stale by a change is fixed in the same pass.** A document
   that ages in silence is worse than a missing one, because it has the
   authority of being written down.
5. **`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical below the H1.** Edit one,
   edit the other.
6. **Everything is versioned; the only exception is a secret.** `.claude/` and
   `.continue/` are tracked on purpose. A new `.gitignore` exception beyond
   secrets requires an ADR, never a silent line.
7. **Granting the agent a permission is the owner's act** — written into
   `.claude/settings.json` with its reason and how to revert it, never applied
   silently and never left as a promise in prose.
8. **A new decision becomes an ADR** in `docs/decisions.md`, in the same pass.
9. **You commit, and nothing is finished until you have.** The commit is the
   last step of the task, not a follow-up — never report work as done while it
   sits uncommitted. One subject per commit; a large delivery is split into
   blocks.

---

<!-- QUEUE-RULE:repodocs -->

## The queue empties by production, and by nothing else

> Marked echo. The single source is **[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/conventions.md#1-continue-is-the-queue--docs-is-what-has-been-produced)**
> — change it there, not here. This block is regenerated.

**`.continue/` holds work that does not exist yet.** A document leaves it when —
and **only** when — the thing it describes **exists**. Length is not an exit
condition. Neither is age, language, untidiness, the end of a session, or an
agent who would have written it differently.

> `tela.md` says *"a black screen with a yellow ball in the middle"*. It leaves
> the queue when there is a black screen with a yellow ball. Until then it stays,
> at any length, in whatever shape it is in — because until then it is the only
> place that thing exists.

**"Produce", applied to a queue item, means making the thing exist.** Not editing
the document, not translating it, not promoting it to `docs/`. The document is
the specification; the deliverable is the thing. Removing the document is the
**last step of the commit that carries the work** — never a step of its own.

**Never empty this folder as tidying.** A queue item deleted without the work
being done destroys the only artefact a project has before it has code — and
what usually replaces it is worse than the loss: a `docs/` page describing a
screen nobody built, indistinguishable from a page describing one that exists.
If a plan has to be visible in `docs/` before it is built, it is `PROPOSED`,
never `ACTIVE`.

**The half-a-page rule is about a record that ended up in the queue**, and about
nothing else. It has no opinion on the length of a specification of unbuilt
work: a 1,300-line brief about something that does not exist is in the only
place it can be. A long queue item is a project with a lot still to build.

**The queue is written in the language its author thinks in**, and becomes
English (US) on the way out, when the work is produced and the document moves to
`docs/`. A Portuguese draft in `.continue/` is not a violation to be fixed.

<!-- /QUEUE-RULE -->

<!-- LANGUAGE-RULE:repodocs -->

## Language — English (US) at home, the upstream's when we are guests

> Marked echo. The single source is **[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/conventions.md#8-language)**
> — change it there, not here. This block is regenerated.

**Everything that lives in this repository, or in GitHub's interface around it,
is written in English (US)**: documents, **commit messages**, pull request titles
and bodies, issues, code comments, changelog entries, release notes.

Commit format: `X.Y.Z - short description in English`. The version comes from
`version.md` and is bumped in the same commit. Conventional Commits prefixes
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) and vague one-word messages are forbidden.

**Three carve-outs, and only three.** The first is end-user-facing strings — UI
text, transactional email, product copy: product i18n for a Brazilian audience,
not repository content. The second is the **Blue3 internal repositories**
(`BLUE3-ISP/*`, `samirhvbr/blue3-intranet`, `samirhvbr/blue3-ai-login`), which
are Portuguese throughout — if you are reading this block inside one of them,
this is the wrong block: they carry `LANGUAGE-RULE-PT`. A repository joins that
set by a written decision, never by argument.

**The third is `.continue/`.** The queue is written in the language its author
thinks in, and becomes English (US) when the work is **produced** and the
document moves to `docs/`. A Portuguese draft in the queue is not a violation to
be fixed: it is unfinished work in the language it is being thought in, and
translating it or moving it out before the thing exists destroys the only place
that thing exists.

History is not rewritten: Portuguese messages already in the log stay as they
are.

**In a repository that is not ours, the upstream's conventions win — the
language and the commit shape both.** Opening a pull request or an issue on a
repository we do not own makes us guests, and a guest writes in the host's
language. Our `X.Y.Z - description` is meaningless there anyway: they have no
`version.md` of ours, and no version for us to bump.

**Check before you write, and the first signal that answers wins:** a written
instruction (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, a pull request or issue template, a contribution
section in the README), then the last ~20 merged pull requests, then the issues,
then the commit log. A written instruction beats observed practice — if they ask
for English and their log is Portuguese, write English. Below that line the
**clear majority** decides, and clear means clear.

**When you cannot tell, write English (US).** A private repository, an empty
history, no network, a refused `gh` call and a genuinely mixed log all land in
the same place — the house rule. Unverifiable is not a licence to guess.

**This is a scope boundary, not a second carve-out.** Nothing in *our*
repositories changes because a foreign one is Portuguese, and code identifiers
are English wherever you are.

<!-- /LANGUAGE-RULE -->

---

## Language — the queue exception is now the fleet norm

> **This section is deliberately OUTSIDE the `QUEUE-RULE` and `LANGUAGE-RULE`
> blocks above.** Those are marked echoes, regenerated from repodocs; anything
> written inside the markers is erased by the next fleet pass with nobody
> noticing.

**What it says is no longer local.** `.continue/` in Portuguese, and an item
leaving the queue only when the thing has been built, were decided here first —
[ADR-009](docs/decisions.md#adr-009--an-item-leaves-continue-only-when-it-has-been-built)
and [ADR-010](docs/decisions.md#adr-010--continue-is-written-in-portuguese-everything-else-is-english),
on the day the queue of this repository was emptied and restored. On 07/09/2026
the fleet adopted both, as **ADR-021** and **ADR-022** in
[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/decisions.md),
and they arrive here in the `QUEUE-RULE` block above.

So this is no longer an exception to anything: the two local ADRs stay as the
record of **where the decision was made**, and the rule itself is now read from
the block, which is regenerated. If the two ever disagree, the block is the
source.

Two details this repository holds that the fleet rule does not spell out, and
both survive: `.continue/README.md` is the folder's index rather than queue
material, and is English like the rest; and writing the `docs/` page in English
is part of checking that the thing was actually built.
---

## One session per worktree

> **Deliberately OUTSIDE the marked echo blocks above.** This is a local rule,
> not a fleet one; written inside the markers it would be erased by the next
> regeneration with nobody noticing.

**Two agent sessions may not share a working tree.** One session, one worktree —
`git worktree add`, or a separate clone. This is not a style preference, and the
cost of ignoring it is on the record from the day the rule was written:

- A blanket `git add -A` in one session swept another session's scratch file
  into its commit and published it, along with a stray 16-byte file the first
  session had left in the repository root.
- A `Cargo.lock` change — the `rustls` security bump of 1.4.4 — was reverted
  under the session that made it, between the command that wrote it and the
  command that read it back. It was noticed only because the version was
  re-read; a commit two seconds earlier would have shipped nothing.
- Two `cargo test` runs on one `target/` produced a failure that took twelve
  clean runs to fail to reproduce, and it is still in the queue as an unexplained
  intermittent.

**None of those was a mistake anybody made.** They are what concurrent writers to
one tree produce, and no amount of care inside a session prevents them, because
the other session is not in it.

**Practically:** start a session with `git worktree add ../tura-notes-<subject>`,
work there, push from there. The hooks are `core.hooksPath`-based and per-clone,
so a fresh worktree needs `git config core.hooksPath tools/git-hooks` once, the
same as a fresh clone. Delete the worktree when the work is merged.

**If you find yourself sharing a tree anyway** — it happens, a session inherits a
directory — then say so before you commit, prefer `git add <path>` over
`git add -A`, and re-read `version.md` and `git log` immediately before writing
a commit rather than trusting what you read earlier in the session.

---

## Branch

**`master`, never `main`.** The default branch of every repository in this fleet
is `master` — a house convention so that every script, hook and runbook can say
`origin/master` and be right. A repo created as `main` gets renamed with GitHub's
rename (it keeps open PRs and redirects old links); every existing clone then
needs `git branch -m main master`, `git fetch origin`,
`git branch -u origin/master master` and — the step people skip —
`git remote set-head origin -a`.

A different branch is fine **only as a written decision**, recorded in
`docs/decisions.md`.

Norm: [samirhvbr/repodocs `docs/conventions.md`](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/conventions.md).

---

<!-- COMMIT-RULE:repodocs -->

## Commits — you commit, and nothing is delivered until you have

> Marked echo. The single source is **[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/versioning.md#who-commits-and-when)**
> — change it there, not here. This block is regenerated.

**Committing is your job.** Not "leave the tree ready and something downstream
packages it" — you run `git commit`, and `git push`, as the last step of the work
you were asked to do. The COMMITTER skill that used to commit on an agent's
behalf is `enabled: false` in every repository of this fleet since 03/09/2026;
what is left of it is a kill-switch, not a scheduler. **If you do not commit,
nobody does.**

**Do not report a task as finished before the commit exists.** "Done",
"delivered", "concluded" mean the work is in `git log` — never that it is sitting
uncommitted where only this session can see it. The commit is the last step *of
the task*, not a follow-up for someone else. If you are about to write
"finished", commit first, then write it.

**Push is part of the delivery, and a refused push is the one place a human enters.**
Commit *and* push, every delivery — a clean push needs nobody's permission and is never
held back for review. When the push is **refused** (conflict, non-fast-forward, protected
branch), stop there and say so: never force, never rewrite history to get past it, never
invent a merge resolution you have not verified. The gate is the refused push, not the
commit.

**Every commit obeys the versioning rules**, with no exception:

- Subject `X.Y.Z - short description in English (US)`, the version taken from
  `version.md` and **bumped in the same commit**.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` entry is written first — its `## X.Y.Z - description`
  heading *is* the subject.
- No Conventional Commits prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) and no vague
  subject ("update", "ajuste", "wip", "changes", "several improvements").

**The bump is the one clause a repository may override — in writing.** If this
repository's own documentation says the version is stamped some other way, and says
why, follow that. Otherwise the line above applies to you. An override nobody wrote
down is not an exception. Nothing else in this block bends: the changelog entry, the
subject, the language, one subject per commit, and committing before you report done
all hold regardless.

**All of this governs the repositories we own.** In a repository that is not
ours, the host's commit convention governs instead — their subject line, in
their language. `X.Y.Z` is meaningless where there is no `version.md` of ours,
and there is no version there for us to bump. Our versioning rules govern our
remotes, not every remote we can push to.

**One subject per commit.** The subject has to describe the whole commit
honestly. The moment your description needs an "and" to be true, it is two
commits.

**Split a large delivery into blocks.** A complex task is committed as a series
of commits grouped by subject, each small enough to be described in one line and
read on its own. They may share a version — bump `version.md` in the first and
repeat the number in the rest; two commits carrying one version is expected, not
a mistake. **Splitting is the default** for anything non-trivial, because the
history is the documentation of *how* the work was done, and one commit touching
six unrelated subjects documents none of them.

**The standard you are keeping:** someone reading `git log` alone — a year from
now, without the conversation that produced the work — can say what happened,
when, why, and at which version. If your commit would fail that test, it is too
big or its subject is too vague, and both are fixed the same way.

<!-- /COMMIT-RULE -->

---

## Version and commits (mandatory)

Format: `version - short description in English`. The version comes from
[version.md](version.md), **bumped in the same commit**:

<!-- The X/Y/Z slots and the discipline are the fleet convention. What counts as
     a Z is per-project — replace these with this project's real triggers. -->

- **Z** — a command, a shortcut, an editor or sidebar behaviour, a settings
  field, a preview or parsing fix, a documentation page, a bug fix. The normal
  case; every change is at least a `Z`.
- **Y** — a completed roadmap milestone; a new crate under `crates/`; a change
  to the `FileSystemAdapter` surface; an index-schema change that forces a
  reindex; an ADR that reverses an earlier one **or overrides a fleet
  convention**.
- **X** — reserved; a stable release, by hand.

Forbidden: `feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` prefixes and vague messages ("ajuste",
"update", "wip"). Several commits may share one version — group by subject, bump
in the first, repeat the number in the rest.

**Write the `CHANGELOG.md` entry first: its `## X.Y.Z - description` heading
*is* the commit subject.** Bodies are narrative — what changed, why, and what it
measured — not bullet lists.

**The version is the FIRST semver in `version.md`** — a bare string and a
markdown document both satisfy that.

**Every version gets a tag named exactly after it — no `v` prefix — and a
published GitHub Release.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` does it on every push
that touches `version.md`, calling `tools/release.sh`; run that script by hand
for a backfill. Both skip what already exists.

**The `version.md` on GitHub equals the Releases on GitHub.** Your local checkout
does not enter the calculation. A PR publishes nothing; the moment it merges, the
Release becomes that version.

**The bump and the Release are one act.** A commit that bumps `version.md` is not
finished until that version has a Release and the `Latest` badge is on it — same
push, not "later". `./tools/release.sh` is idempotent and also repairs a drifted
badge.

Full rules: [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## Before closing a version

- [ ] What changed is in `CHANGELOG.md`, with the **why**, not just the what.
- [ ] A new or changed document is in `docs/` — not in the queue, not in the
      commit body.
- [ ] A finished item **left** `.continue/`.
- [ ] A document made stale by this change was corrected in the same pass.
- [ ] `version.md` bumped, in this commit.
- [ ] **The work is committed** — and split into one commit per subject if it
      covered more than one. Nothing is reported as finished while it is
      uncommitted.
- [ ] The **tag and the GitHub Release** exist for this version. Normally the
      workflow does it on push; `./tools/release.sh` if you need it now.
- [ ] The twins still match: `diff <(tail -n +2 CLAUDE.md) <(tail -n +2 AGENTS.md)`.
